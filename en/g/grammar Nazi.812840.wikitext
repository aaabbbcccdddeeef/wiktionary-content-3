'''Grammar Nazi''' (mockingly, '''grammer natzee'''; alternatively capitalized and uncapitalized), '''spelling Nazi''', and '''language Nazi''' are all terms used to describe a participant in a discussion (usually [[online]]) who criticizes or habitually corrects the language usage of another participant. Such a person is often accused of [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]] as a result of finding fault with minor details of other participants' messages and often only in opinions with which the accused grammar Nazi disagrees. Participants in these discussions often end up taking opposite sides in a [[Prescription and description|prescription versus description]] debate, without realizing it.

The many exceptions and intricacies of the [[English language]] can present a problem for even the most experienced user. This, combined with the frequency of [[typographical error]]s caused by the desire to post quickly on [[instant messenger]]s, often makes it very easy to find an error in a message with which to find fault. In other languages, if [[spelling]] is not an issue, moods, agreement, [[diacritic]]s, and tenses provide an ample supply of possibilities for misunderstanding and argument.

Grammar Nazis can sometimes focus solely on the stylistic manner by which an issue comes across, which is viewed at times as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' attack, but grammar Nazis retort that grammatical and spelling errors and stylistic flaws may make an argument hard to follow, making various people (whether or not they are actually grammar Nazis) want to correct the flaws, and then, after they have sorted out what the substance of the argument in question is, dive into the debate itself.
