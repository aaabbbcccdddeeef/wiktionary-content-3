'''Grammar Nazi''' (mockingly, '''grammer natzee'''; alternatively capitalised and uncapitalised), '''Spelling Nazi''' and '''Language Nazi''' are all terms used to describe a participant in a discussion, online or otherwise, who criticizes or corrects the language usage of another participant. Such a person is often accused of [[flaming]] as a result of finding fault with minor details of other participants' messages and often only in opinions with which the accused Grammar Nazi disagrees. Participants in these discussions often end up taking opposite sides in a [[Prescription and description|prescription versus description]] debate, without realizing it.

These terms are considered derogatory by some. Others view Grammar Nazism as a virtue and insist upon strict usage of the language in question, as a craftsman minds his tools. These individuals accept the badge of "Grammar Nazi" with pride, as one might a bruise from a bully. In some situations, such as casual conversation, using grammatical errors that are commonly accepted, Grammar Nazis are chastised for their pedantry.

The many exceptions and intricacies of the [[English language]] can present a problem for even the most experienced user. This, combined with the frequency of [[typographical error]]s caused by the want to post quickly often makes it very easy to find an error in a message with which to find fault. In other languages, if spelling is not an issue, moods, agreement, [[diacritic]]s, and tenses provide an ample supply of opportunities to stumble.

Grammar Nazis can sometimes focus solely on the ''way'' an issue is coming across to another side, which is viewed at times as an [[ad hominem]] attack; on the other hand, errors and stylistic flaws may make an argument hard to follow, making various people, whether or not they are labeled Grammar Nazis, want to correct the flaws, and then after they have sorted out what the substance of the statement(s) in question is, dive into the argument itself.

==Origin of the phrase==
The term "Grammar Nazi", along with its cognates "Spelling Nazi", "[[Soup Nazi]]", and "Food Nazi", is a reference to the [[Nazism|Nazis]], members of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] under [[Adolf Hitler]]. The Nazis were known for their feelings of mastery and superiority, coupled with harsh, merciless, unilateral action. However, as used today the phrase has no direct connection to [[National Socialist German Workers Party|national socialism]], just as calling someone a [[vandalism|vandal]] does not mean she is a [[Vandals|Vandal]]. The uncapitalized initial letter indicates the common noun.

These uses are offensive to some, as the controversy in the popular press over the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' "[[Soup Nazi]]" episode indicates, but the terms are used so frequently as to inspire "[[Godwin's Law]]".

==Other languages==
