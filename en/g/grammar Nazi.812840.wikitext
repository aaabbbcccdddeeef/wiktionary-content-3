'''Grammar nazi''', '''spelling nazi''', and '''language nazi''' are all [[derogatory]] terms used to describe participants in a discussion, online or otherwise, who criticize or correct the language usage of other participants. Such a person is often accused of [[flaming]] by finding fault with minor details of other participants' messages, and usually only in opinions with which the person disagrees. Participants in these discussions often end up taking opposite sides in a [[Prescription and description| prescription versus description]] debate. This is also used as a [[red herring]] when someone has no real argument, to discredit the other person on unrelated issues.

The many exceptions and intricacies of [[English language]] spelling can present a problem for even the most experienced user. In addition, the instantaneous nature of the Internet discourages carefully editing one's posts before submission. This, combined with the possibility of typographical errors, often makes it very easy to find a [[spelling]] error in a message with which a user could choose to find fault. In other languages with more regular spelling, other grammatical features might be criticized, such as use of the [[subjunctive mood]] or the placement of [[diacritic]]s.

The grammar nazi's method of argument often ignores the content of another user's argument and focuses on its quality, distracting from the issue at hand. This method may become an [[ad hominem]] attack, which is a [[logical fallacy]].
