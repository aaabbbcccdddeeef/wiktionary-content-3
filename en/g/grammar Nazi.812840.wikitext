'''Grammar nazi''', '''spelling nazi''', and '''language nazi''' are all terms used to describe participants in a discussion, online or otherwise, who criticize or correct the language usage of other participants. In general, people accuse another person of being a grammar nazi, in which case the use is [[derogatory]]. Such a person is often accused of [[flaming]] by finding fault with minor details of other participants' messages, and usually only in opinions with which the person disagrees. Participants in these discussions often end up taking opposite sides in a [[Prescription and description| prescription versus description]] debate.

However, some people do view grammar nazism as a virtue rather than a flaw, and insist upon strict usage of the language in question. These are more likely to wear the badge of "grammar nazi" with pride, and can even refer to themselves in this manner. In some situations, a more relaxed method of speech or prose is appropriate; it is these where, in general, grammar nazis are chastised.

The many exceptions and intricacies of [[English language]] spelling can present a problem for even the most experienced user. In addition, the instantaneous nature of the Internet discourages carefully editing one's posts before submission. This, combined with the possibility of typographical errors, often makes it very easy to find a [[spelling]] error in a message with which a user could choose to find fault. In other languages with more regular spelling, other grammatical features might be criticized, such as use of the [[subjunctive mood]] or the placement of [[diacritic]]s.

The grammar nazi's method of argument often ignores the content of another user's argument and focuses on its quality, distracting from the issue at hand. This method may become an ''[[ad hominem]]'' attack, which is a [[logical fallacy]]. On the other hand, errors and stylistic flaws may themselves make an argument hard to follow, and for this reason may be deliberately introduced by [[internet troll|trolls]].
