'''Grammar nazi''', '''spelling nazi''', and '''language nazi''' are all [[derogatory]] terms used to describe participants in a discussion (online or otherwise) who criticize or correct the language usage of other participants. These terms are often associated with accusations that a person is [[flaming]] by finding fault with minor details of other participants' messages, and usually only in opinions with which the person disagrees. Participants in these discussions often end up taking opposite sides in a [[Prescription and description| prescriptive/descriptive]] debate.

With many exceptions and intricacies, [[English language|English]] spelling can present a problem for even the most experienced user.  In addition, the instantaneous nature of the Internet promotes a tendency away from carefully editing one's posts before submission.  Add the possibility of typographical errors, and it is often very easy to find a [[spelling]] error in a message with which a spelling nazi could choose to find fault.  In other languages with more regular spelling, other grammatical features might be criticized, such as the [[subjunctive mood]] or, in [[Italian language|Italian]], the placement of [[diacritic|diacritics]].

The fundamental problem with a grammar nazi's method of argument is that it ignores the content of someone's post and focuses on its quality, distracting from the issue at hand.  It becomes an [[ad hominem]] attack, which is generally to be avoided in useful debate.
