Gizzing is an English word that comes from the word ''giz'' in arabic which means to hang around, flirt and do nothing productive. Gizzing is being used more commonly nowadays in the UK, USA, France, Spain, Portugal and Mexico. However the word ''giz'' shouldn't be mistaken for ''gaz'' which in Iran is a type of food similar to nougat.
