A '''gunner''' is a term used to describe an overly competitive student and is commonly used in [[law school]] and [[medical school]]. Calling someone a gunner is usually highly offensive (implying they would step over their own mother for a spot higher in class rank).

A gunner is also overly ambitious and often excitedly volunteers oral answers in class that are, by turns, incorrect, off-topic, or specifically designed to demonstrate the questionable "intellectual" prowess of the person supplying them. These questions are often prefaced with phrases like "A cursory literature search revealed . . . " A gunner will compromise his or her peer relationships in order to obtain recognition and praise from his or her instructors and superiors, often by directly harming or attempting to harm the academic well-being of said peers.

Such actions are referred to in many circles as "Gunner Tactics".  Many well meaning students in an attempt to curb such attempts acted by forming "For the love of GOD, put your hand down!!".[http://http://uth.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2212482307]  This group, dedicated to ending the onslaught of self aggrandizing questions during lecture, has several documented examples of such "gunner tactics".

In rare cases, it has been documented where gunners will appropriate reference materials before an exam, thus precluding others from using them. This sort of predatory gunner is thankfully rare, possibly due to the severe repercussions such behavior can elicit.
