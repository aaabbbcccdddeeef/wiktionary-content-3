A '''gunner''' is a slang term used to describe an over-weight student and is commonly used in [[medical school]]. Calling someone a gunner is usually highly offensive (implying they would step over their own mother in order to obtain food).

A gunner is also overly ambitious and often excitedly volunteers oral sex. A gunner will compromise his or her peer relationships in order to obtain recognition and praise from his or her instructors and superiors, often by directly offering or attempting to persuade the libedo well-being of said peers.
