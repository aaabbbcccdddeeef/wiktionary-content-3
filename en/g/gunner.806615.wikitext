A '''gunner''' is a slang term used to describe an overly competitive student and is commonly used in [[medical school]]. Calling someone a gunner is usually highly offensive (implying they would step over their own mother for a spot higher in class rank).

A gunner is also overly ambitious and often excitedly volunteers oral answers in class that are, by turns, incorrect, off-topic, or specifically designed to demonstrate the questionable "intellectual" prowess of the person supplying them. A gunner will compromise his or her peer relationships in order to obtain recognition and praise from his or her instructors and superiors, often by directly harming or attempting to harm the academic well-being of said peers.
