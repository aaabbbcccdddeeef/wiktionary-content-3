A '''gunner''' is a slang term used to describe a overly competitive student and is commonly used in [[Medical school]] and [[Law school]].  Depending on the context, calling someone a gunner may be either a compliment (meaning their a good student) or offensive (implying they would step over their own mother for a spot higher in class rank).
