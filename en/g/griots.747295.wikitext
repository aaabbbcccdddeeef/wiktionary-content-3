# {{plural of|griot}}
#* '''2007,''' James McBide, ''Hip-Hop Planet'', National Geographic (April 2007), 106,
#*: "The long history is that spoken-word music made its way here on slave ships from West Africa centuries ago:  Ethnomusicologists trace hip-hop's roots to the dance, drum, and song of West African '''griots''', or storytellers, its pairing of word and music the manifestation of the painful journey of slaves who survived the middle passage".
