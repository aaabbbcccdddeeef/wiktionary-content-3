=====Usage notes=====
* The meaning "to have" is found only in perfect tenses but has present meaning; hence "I have got" has the same meaning as "I have". (Sometimes the form ''had got'' is used to mean "had", as in "He said they couldn't find the place because they'd got the wrong address".) In speech and in all except formal writing, the word "have" is normally reduced to /v/ and spelled "-'ve" or dropped entirely (e.g. "I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford", [[w:Slow Train (Bob Dylan song)|''Slow Train'']], Bob Dylan), leading to nonstandard usages such as "he gots" = "he has", "he doesn't got" = "he doesn't have".
* Some dialects (e.g. American English dialects) use both ''[[gotten]]'' and ''[[got]]'' as past participles, while others (e.g. dialects of Southern England) use only [[got]]. In dialects that use both, ''got'' is used for the meanings "to have" and "to have to", while ''gotten'' is used for all other meanings.<ref>[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/gotten.html http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/gotten.html] and [http://www.miketodd.net/encyc/gotten.htm http://www.miketodd.net/encyc/gotten.htm]</ref> This allows for a distinction between "I've gotten a ticket" (I have received or obtained a ticket) vs. "I've got a ticket" (I currently have a ticket).
* "get" is one of the most common verbs in English, and the many meanings may be confusing for language learners. The following table indicates some of the different constructions found, along with the most common meanings of each:
