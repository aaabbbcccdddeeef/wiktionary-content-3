GCC was originally an Acronym for "GNU C Compiler", now a Backronym for "GNU Compiler Collection".

This differs from other compilers many of which are developed by commercial companies and specialised to show off their hardware or software. Java support (GCJ) is a new and not yet robust.

The Compiler that the Linux kernel is normally built with and the one that ships as standard on most GNU/Linux systems.
