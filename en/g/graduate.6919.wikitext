====Usage notes====
In the sense “to complete studies”, usage has shifted from the 19th century through the 21st century.<ref name="garner">''Garner's Modern American Usage,'' Bryan Garner, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&pg=PA399&dq=graduate pp. 399–400]</ref> Originally (from the 16th century) used transitively as “the school '''graduated''' the student” or passively as “the student ''was'' '''graduated''' [''from'' the school, ''by'' the school]”; compare {{m|en|certified}}. In the 19th century began to be used as an [[ergative]] verb in the intransitive form “the student '''graduated''' ''from'' school”, “the student '''graduated'''”; the ergative occurs in English for change of state (compare {{m|en|break}}, {{m|en|melt}}), and reverses the subject compared to the transitive form: the student is the subject, not the school. This was originally proscribed, but was generally accepted by mid-20th century, and is now the preferred usage. The form “''was'' '''graduated''' ''from''” is a fossil, seen primarily in wedding invitations and obituaries, though the active form “the school '''graduated''' the student” is still in use. A further shift started mid-20th century, using the verb transitively with student subject, as in “the student '''graduated''' college” (note no “from”; compare {{m|en|completed}}). This has been used in major periodicals from the 1990s, but remains proscribed into the 21st century, being considered at best informal, at worst uneducated.

Note that there are thus two transitive forms, with the subject and object switching between the school and the student: “I '''graduated''' Indiana University” (newer, proscribed) vs. “Indiana University '''graduated''' me” (older, somewhat old-fashioned).
