# A geofence is a boundary defined around a location or area on the Earth's surface. The current position of an asset (typically obtained using GPS) is compared with the boundary and an alert triggered on entry or exit. A geofence may be a simple circle defined by a centre coordinate and radius, or a more complex shape defined by vertices of a polygon or a series of circular arcs.
