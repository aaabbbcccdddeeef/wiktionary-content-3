===Etymology===
{{coin|en|w=-|Milton Sirotta|in=1920}} who was then the young nephew of American mathematician {{w|Edward Kasner}} who had asked Milton to think of a name for the hypothetical number of 10 to the 100th power. The word was first published in the book ''{{w|Mathematics and the Imagination}}'' (1940).

#* {{quote-book|en|author=Edward Kasner| authorlink=Edward Kasner|author2=James [Roy] Newman| authorlink2=James R. Newman| chapter=New Names for Old| title={{w|Mathematics and the Imagination}}| location=New York, N.Y.| publisher={{w|Simon & Schuster}}| year=1940| page=23| oclc=525772| passage=Words of wisdom are spoken by children at least as often as by scientists. The name "'''googol'''" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely, 1 with a hundred zeros after it. He was very certain that this number was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. {{...}} A googolplex is much bigger than a '''googol''', much bigger than a '''googol''' times a '''googol'''. A '''googol''' times a '''googol''' would be 1 with 200 zeros, whereas a googolplex is one with a '''googol''' of zeros. You will get some idea of the size of this very large but finite number from the fact that there would not be enough room to write it, if you went to the farthest star, touring all the nebulae and putting down zeros every inch of the way.}}
#* '''1979''', {{w|Steven Pinker}}, "Formal models of language learning", ''Language, Cognition, and Human Nature'':
#*: For example, in considering all the finite state grammars that use seven terminal symbols and seven auxiliary symbols (states), [...] he must test over a '''googol''' (10^100) candidates.
#* '''1980''', {{w|Carl Sagan}}, ''[[w:Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]'', chapter IX
#*: If the universe were packed solid with neutrons, say, so there was no empty space anywhere, there would still only be about 10<sup>128</sup> particles in it, quite a bit more than a '''googol''' but trivially small compared to a googolplex.
