{{rfc-split| â€” This belongs at [[gert]]}}

===Adjective===
Slang term used in the Bristolian accent meaning big or very, eg. "that's a big sandwhich" would become "that's a gert sandwhich" or "that's a gert big sandwhich". Can also be succeeded by the word lush to create the Bristol saying "gert lush" meaning very good. Gert lush is the greatest compliment you can recieve from a Bristolian.
