'''Grognard''' (Fr. "grumbler" from Fr. "grogner" 1. snarl 2. grunt 3. growl 4. grumble [râler] 5. gripe [râler] and Fr. "grognon" 1. grouch 2. curmudgeon) may mean:

* [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s name for old veteran soldiers; specifically the Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard (Grenadiers à Pied de la Garde Impériale). They were the soldiers who were old enough to know what was going on, but junior enough in rank not to be able to affect it, and constantly complained about it.<ref>[http://www.napoleonguide.com/glossary.htm Napoleonic Glossary]</ref>
* ''slang'' for someone who enjoys playing [[wargaming#Board wargaming|board wargames]]. This use is supposed to have been coined by John Young in the early 1970s while employed by [[Simulations Publications]], Inc. Originally this term referred to the "old guard" of gamers who were playing military board games prior to 1969.
* Inside the computer game development industry, the term '''grognard''' is used to name fans who will buy every game released in a certain genre of game ([[Real-time strategy|RTS]], [[Computer role-playing game|RPG]], etc.). These dedicated game players are often viewed as a blessing and a curse, as they will ensure a certain minimum level in sales, but they will also be the most critical of any mistakes or [[Computer bug|bugs]] in the game.
* In the board game, [[role-playing game]], [[miniature wargaming]] and computer game genres, grognard may refer to an ultra-hardcore gamer, seeking reality and assembling detailed tables of probabilities and statistics. Grognard may also refer to someone with a detailed knowledge of real world history without necessarily being interested in becoming a good player or having a detailed knowledge of game mechanics or play. Grognard can also refer to a player who prefers an out-of-print edition of a game to the currently-printed edition.
* The term "grognard capture" extends from this idea of the ultra-hardcore gamer to the consideration of how such gamers' expectations regarding the nature of a game, sequel, or new edition in any of the above genres must be balanced against the difficulties that this may cause new players unfamiliar with the genre, game, or player culture; grognard capture occurs when balance is not met and the new work begins excluding the possibility of new players.  This phrase was coined and later popularized by [[Greg Costikyan]].<ref>[http://www.costik.com/weblog/2003/08/grognard-capture.html Grognard Capture]</ref>
