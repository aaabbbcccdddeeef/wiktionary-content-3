'''Grognard''' (Fr. "grumbler") may mean:

* [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s name for old veteran soldiers; specifically the Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard (Grenadiers à Pied de la Garde Impériale). (derived from the French: grogner : 1. snarl 2. grunt 3. growl 4. grumble (râler) 5. gripe (râler), and grognon : 1. grouch 2. curmudgeon)
* ''slang'' for someone who enjoys playing [[wargaming#Board wargaming|board wargames]]. This use is supposed to have been coined by John Young in the early 1970s while employed by [[Simulations Publications]], Inc.. Originally this term referred to the "old guard" of gamers who were playing tactical board games prior to 1969.
* Inside the computer game development industry, the term '''grognard''' is used to name fans who will buy every game released in a certain genre of game ([[Real-time strategy|RTS]], [[Computer role-playing game|RPG]], etc...). These dedicated game players are often viewed as a blessing and a curse, as they will ensure a certain minimum level in sales, but they will also be the most critical of any mistakes or [[Computer bug|bugs]] in the game.
* In the board game, [[role-playing game]], [[miniature wargaming]] and computer game genres, a grognard is an ultra-hardcore gamer, seeking reality and assembling detailed tables of probabilities and statistics.
* The term "grognard capture" extends from this idea of the ultra-hardcore gamer to the consideration of how such gamers' expectations regarding the nature of a game, sequel, or new edition in any of the above genres must be balanced against the difficulties that this may cause new players unfamiliar with the genre, game, or player culture; grognard capture occurs when balance is not met and the new work begins excluding the possibility of new players.  This phrase was coined and later popularized by [[Greg Costikyan]] [http://www.costik.com/weblog/2003/08/grognard-capture.html].
