|passage=After lunch we picked up Nancy & were off to the '''Great Wall'''. All the way we waved our arms off at the crowds lining the streets to see us & even in the villages after we got out of the country.<br>The Wall has an amazing effect even though you've seen photos & movies of it. There is a feeling I can't describe when you stand on it & see it disappear over the mountains in both directions.}}
