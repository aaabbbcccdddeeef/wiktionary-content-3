===Etymology===
A Common [[Teutonic]] strong verb: Old English ''[[Image:Insular_G.gif]]iefan ([[Image:Insular_G.gif]]eaf, [[Image:Insular_G.gif]]éafon, [[Image:Insular_G.gif]]iefen)'' = [[wikipedia:Old Frisian|Old Frisian]] ''geva, jeva,'' [[wikipedia:Old Saxon|Old Saxon]] ''gean'' ([[wikipedia:Middle Dutch|Middle Dutch]] and Dutch ''geven''), [[Old High German]] ''kepan, geban'' (Middle High German and German ''geben''), [[Old Norse]] ''gefa'' (Swedish ''gifva,'' Danish ''give''), Gothic ''giban'':[[wikipedia:Old Teutonic|Old Teutonic]] *''ge{{unicode|ƀ}}an, gaf, g[[image:Æ_with_Circumflex.gif]]{{unicode|ƀ}}um, ge{{unicode|ƀ}}ono-''. By some the root is identified with that of Lithuanian ''gabénti'' to bring, Old Irish ''gabim'' I take, Latin ''habere'' to have, hold, and [[Sanskrit]] ''gabhasti'' hand.

In Old English the strictly West Saxon forms of the infinitive and the pa. participle show the influence of initial [[image:Insular_G.gif]] in the substitution of ''ie'' (commonly ''i, y'') for the original ''e'' of the root; thus ''[[image:Insular_G.gif]]iefan, [[image:Insular_G.gif]]ifan, [[image:Insular_G.gif]]yfan'' for ''[[image:Insular_G.gif]]efan''. In other dialects the ''e'' was normal, except where it passed into ''eo'' (northern ''ea'') by ''u-'' or ''o-'' [[umlaut]]; but ''i'' occurs very frequently, perhaps owing to the analogy of the 2nd and 3rd person singular present [[indicative]]; on the other hand, the regular ''i'' of the last-mentioned forms is often replaced by the ''e'' of the infinitive. In midland and southern Middle English there are three main forms: ''[[Image:Yogh.gif]]iven,'' ''[[Image:Yogh.gif]]even'' and ''[[Image:Yogh.gif]]eoven''. The third of these is rare, and disappears c1200. The relation of the other two forms is obscure, as both sometimes occur in the same text (e.g., by [[wikipedia:Layamon|Layamon]], where the earlier version favours [[image:Yogh.gif]]''even,'' the later [[Image:Yogh.gif]]''iven,'' but neither is consistent). In such cases the difference may be merely graphic, and due to an indeterminate vowel. Some texts, however, show an exclusive use of one or other of the forms; thus [[image:Yogh.gif]]''iven'' is regular in the ''[[wikipedia:Ancren Riwle|Ancren Riwle]],'' while the ''[[wikipedia:Ayenbite of Inwyt|Ayenbite]]'' has only [[image:Yogh.gif]]''even''. The forms with initial [[wikipedia:guttural|guttural]] are first recorded in the ''[[wikipedia:Ormulum|Ormulum]]'' (? north-east midland, c1200), though the forms with [[image:Yogh.gif]] are much more frequent. (Apparent earlier instances with initial ''g-'' occur only in manuscripts which confuse ''g'' and [[image:Yogh.gif]].) The ''g'' forms, however, certainly originated in the north (though the want of 12th century northern texts renders direct proof impossible); and, as they do not admit of being (like the guttural g of begin) explained as the products of analogy, it seems most probable that they are due to Scandinavian influence. The regular form of the infinitive in early northern texts is ''gif,'' give, which rather corresponds to Swedish ''gifva,'' Danish ''give,'' than to Old Norse ''gefa''. On the other hand, the pa. participle is at an early date written with ''e'' as well as ''i'' (''gefin, gifin,'' etc.), and ''e'' also appears in some contracted forms as ''ges'' (= gives). In the 15th and 16th century, the form ''geve'' (''geif,'' etc.) is common both in English and Scottish writers; Peter Levins in ''Manipulus vocabulorum. A dictionarie of English and Latine wordes,'' 1570, places it along with ''grieve, sleeve,'' etc. In the 14-15th centuries, the northern forms extended themselves gradually to the midland dialects. ''[[wikipedia:Havelok|The Lay of Havelok the Dane]]'' (c1300) has, like the ''Ormulum,'' both the [[image:Yogh.gif]] and the ''g'' forms; [[wikipedia:Robert Mannyng|Robert Manning of Brunne]]'s ''Handlyng Synne'' (1303) has only the former, but his ''Chronicle'' (c1330), according to the two existing manuscripts, has always ''g''. [[wikipedia:William Langland|William Langland]] has both types, well attested by the [[alliteration]], but Chaucer seems to have always written ''yeve, yaf,'' and throughout the greater part of the 15th century the [[palatal]] forms predominate in midland (including East Anglian) as well as in southern writers. The manuscripts of Fortescue have ''g,'' which is common also in the London documents after 1430 (Morsbach, ''Eng. Schriftsprache,'' 98). About 1500, the palatal forms disappear entirely from the literary language, and have left only very faint traces in the modern dialects.

In the 14th-15th century the pa. participle was sometimes conformed to the analogy of the ''e, a, o'' verbs with ''-l, -r'' roots; this took place with both the midland and northern forms, but oven is found more frequently than ''goven''.
