'''growed'''
# {{context|US|dialect}} {{past of|[[grow]]}}

You're kidding right... Growed is NOT a word. The Past tense of "Grow" is "'''Grew'''". The Past Perfer tense is "'''Grown'''"

Sentence: When I is all growed up I hope my english gets gooder.

Do not use this word or you will be perceived as ignorant.
