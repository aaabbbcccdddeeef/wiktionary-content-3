{{also|Gag|GAG}}
==English==

===Etymology===
The verb is from 15th-century {{inh|en|enm|gaggen}}, Early Modern English {{m|en|gagge}}, possibly imitative or perhaps related to or influenced by {{der|en|non|gaghals|gag-háls}} {{gloss|"with head thrown backwards"; > Norwegian dialectal {{m|no|gaga||bent backwards}}}}. The intransitive sense "to retch" is from 1707.

The noun is from the 16th century, figurative use (for "repression of speech") from the 1620s. The secondary meaning "(practical) joke" is from 1863, of unclear origin.
