{grasscloth}

# {{Originally made in Japan but is now produced in other far eastern countries. Made from dried grasses, reeds, split bark, and spilt canes which are sometimes dyed. The grasses are woven with silk or cotton thread to form a random design which is adhered to a paper backing. Some types have the background showing through as part of the design, others have the whole surface dyed.   }
