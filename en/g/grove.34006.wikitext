# To [[cultivate]] in '''groves'''; to grow naturally so as to form groves.
#* '''1841''', R, Sapp, ''Orchard Lake'', in L. L. Hamline (editor), ''The Ladies Repository'', Volume 1, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aSvZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA165&dq=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&f=false page 165],
#*: It is called "Orchard Lake," from the fact, that near the centre is an island embracing an area of about fifty acres of land, well '''groved''' with different kinds of shrubbery; and near the centre of this island stand a number of aged apple-trees, planted, perhaps, a century since by the hand of some Indian.
#* '''1822''', Robert Chapman, ''The Topographical Picture of Glasgow in its Ancient and Modern State'', 3rd Edition, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GCUNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA195&dq=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&f=false page 195],
#*: The trees and shrubs are not arranged after any particular system, but are scattered or '''groved''' together in various parts of the garden.
#* '''1984''', ''Queensland Botany Bulletin'', Issue 3, Department of Primary Industries, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yoolAQAAMAAJ&q=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&dq=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y page 82],
#*: Virtually recognizable '''groving''' occurs in some ''A. aneura'' associations in the west. Further east some diffuse '''groving''' may occur, but is difficult to recognize without the benefit of aerial photographs.
# {{lb|en|forestry|of trees}} To cultivate with periodic harvesting that also serves to create order (gaps and lines of trees) to facilitate further harvesting.
#* '''1842''' February 5, ''The Gardeners Chronicle'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_Sw1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA86&dq=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&f=false page 86],
#*: In Herefordshire, especially on the northern and eastern sides, Oak timber abounds; and in many of the woods it is usual to have felling at periods varying from sixteen to twenty years; the straightest and handsomest are left for timber, or, as it is called, '''groved'''; and they are from time to time thinned, and a regular distance kept between them. The effect produced on these '''groved''' trees is, that from being exposed to air and sun, the rapidity of their growth is increased in bulk, height, and quality; and in sixty or eighty years they become valuable timber.
# To [[plough]] or [[gouge]] with lines.
#* '''1823''', ''Instinct'', in "Sholto and Reuben Percy" ([[w:Thomas Byerley (journalist)|Thomas Byerley]]), ''The Percy Anecdotes: Original and Select'', Volume 9: Instinct—Ingenuity, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=T-ZBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA138&dq=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&f=false page 138],
#*: Very frequently, however, to shorten the distance to the upper nurseries, where they<sup>[the ants]</sup> have to take the eggs, they project an arch of about ten inches in length, and half an inch in breadth, '''groved''' or worked into steps, on its upper surface, to allow of a more easy passage.
#* '''1841''', {{w|New York State Assembly}}, ''Documents of the Assembly of the State of New York'', Volume 2, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xVYbAQAAIAAJ&pg=PP28&dq=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22groved%22%7C%22groving%22&f=false page 14],
#*: The floor of first story and piazza to be laid with Georgia pine, in narrow courses planed, '''groved''' and tongued, and laid in the best manner.
