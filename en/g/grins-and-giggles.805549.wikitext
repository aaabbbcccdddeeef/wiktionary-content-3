The expression "grins and giggles" has the same meaning as the expression "just for the heck of it".
It implies that something should be done because it could be helpful, it is not hard to do, and has little or no adverse consequences.
Example.  "We have too many spare roofing tiles, and those guys need to learn how to install them, so let's put them on that temporary structure over there just for grins and giggles."
