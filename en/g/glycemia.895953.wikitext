# {{lb|en|medicine|American spelling}} Presence of [[glucose]] in the [[blood]] (which is always true), and {{lb|en|usually, more specifically}} average concentration thereof over time, and its regulation; in this sense, glycemia is [[hypernym]]ic to [[euglycemia]], [[hyperglycemia]], and [[hypoglycemia]], and a mention of glycemia is a reference to blood sugar regulation and degree or quality thereof.

Determination of serum fructosamine levels, on the other hand, offers several potential advantages over these current measures. Our goal was to evaluate the utility of serum fructosamine as a measure of '''glycemia'''. […] Fructosamine levels were measured in 145 normal and diabetic subjects aged 20 to 86 years. The measured levels were then related to standard measures of '''glycemia''', including glycosylated hemoglobin, glycosylated albumin, and fasting glucose. The effects of chronic illness and medications known to alter glucose tolerance were also investigated. […] Assay of serum fructosamine appears to be comparable to that of HbA1C for determination of glycemic control.}}
