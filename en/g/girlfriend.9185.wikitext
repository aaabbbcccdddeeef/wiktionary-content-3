'''
1. A female partner in a non-marital romantic relationship.'''

In contrast to its female equivalent, boyfriend, Girlfriend is a relatively modern term, and in the past has had implications of an illicit relationship (as sexual and romantic relationships outside marriage were generally frowned upon). It is now a generally accepted term and has no negative implications.

Use of girfriend generally implies that the male is a girl or a young woman. An older woman in a non-marital relationship and sometimes even a young woman in a long-term relationship is more often described as a significant other or partner.
