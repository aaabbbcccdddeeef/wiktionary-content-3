====Usage notes====
*''G'day'' is used as an everyday [[greeting]] in Australia and New Zealand in the way that ''[[hello]]'' is in the UK and ''[[hi]]'' is in the US.  It is most commonly conjugated as ''G'day, mate'' which can imply a greeting to a friend or a friendly greeting to a stranger.  Less common usage is ''G'day, stranger'' or ''G'day.  Howzit goin?''
*Stereotypes: G'day is often stereotyped to be used commonly in Australian and New Zealand culture, although it is not as common as [[hi]] or [[hey]], especially in most capital cities.
* The expression has gained popularity with the increased exposure of Australian and New Zealand film and TV stars such as [[w:Steve Irwin|Steve Irwin]] and [[w:Paul Hogan|Paul Hogan]].
* Although it is a contraction of the phrase ''Good day'', the use of ''G'day'' as a parting comment is extremely uncommon in Australia.
