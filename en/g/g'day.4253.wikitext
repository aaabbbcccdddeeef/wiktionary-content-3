====Usage notes====
{{unreferenced}}
* ''G'day'' is used as an everyday [[greeting]] in Australia and New Zealand in the way that ''[[hello]]'' is in the UK and ''[[hi]]'' is in the US.  It is most commonly conjugated as ''G'day, mate'' which can imply a greeting to a friend or a friendly greeting to a stranger.  Less common usage is ''G'day, stranger'' or ''G'day.  Howzit goin?''
* Stereotypes: G'day is often stereotyped to be used commonly in Australian, although it is not as common as [[hi]] or [[hey]], especially in most capital cities.  It is also less common among young people than among adults.
* The expression has gained popularity with the increased exposure of Australian film and TV stars such as [[w:Steve Irwin|Steve Irwin]] and [[w:Paul Hogan|Paul Hogan]].
* As the term ''Good day'' is generally used as a parting comment, the term ''G'day'' is also ironic in that there is an incongruity between what is expected and what actually is.
* The expression also has a separate origin in the [[w:Ottawa_Valley_Twang|Ottawa Valley]] of Ontario, Canada.
