====Usage notes====
* {{sense|good day}} Used interchangeably with {{term|hello|lang=en}} and {{term|hi|lang=en}}, but more characteristically (and stereotypically) Australian/New Zealand, and perhaps the most informal of these options.  Also used in the constructions ''G′day, mate'' (a greeting to a friend or acquaintance) and ''G′day, stranger'' (ironically, to a friend not seen in some time).
