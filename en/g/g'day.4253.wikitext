====Usage notes====
* {{sense|good day}} Used interchangeably with {{m|en|hello}} and {{m|en|hi}}, but more characteristically (and stereotypically) Australian/New Zealand, and perhaps the most informal of these options. Also used in the constructions ''G'day, mate'' (a greeting to a friend or acquaintance) and ''G'day, stranger'' (ironically, to a friend not seen in some time).
