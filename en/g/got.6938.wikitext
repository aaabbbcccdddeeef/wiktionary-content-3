===Verb===
'''got'''

# {{simple past of|''[[get]]''}}
#:''We '''got''' the last bus home.''
# {{UK}} {{past participle of|[[get]]}}
#:''By that time we'd '''got''' very cold.''
#:''I've '''got''' two children.''
#:''How many children have you '''got'''?''
#:'''Usage note:''' The second sentence literally means "At some time in the past I got (obtained) two children", but in "have got" constructions like this, where "got" is used in the sense of "obtained", the sense of obtaining is lost, becoming merely one of possessing, and the sentence is in effect just a more colloquial way of saying "I have two children". Similarly, the third sentence is just a more colloquial way of saying "How many children do you have?"
#Expressing obligation.
#:''I can't go out tonight, I've '''got''' to study for my exams.''
#:'''Usage note:''' "Got" is a filler word here with no obvious grammatical or semantic function. "I have to study for my exams" has the same meaning.
