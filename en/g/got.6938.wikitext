====Usage notes====
* {{sense|past participle of get}} The second sentence literally means "At some time in the past I got (obtained) two children", but in "have got" constructions like this, where "got" is used in the sense of "obtained", the sense of obtaining is lost, becoming merely one of possessing, and the sentence is in effect just a more colloquial way of saying "I have two children". Similarly, the third sentence is just a more colloquial way of saying "How many children do you have?"
* {{sense|past participle of get}} The American usage of the verb conjugates as get-got-gotten, as opposed to the British usage, which conjugates as get-got-got.
* {{sense|expressing obligation}} "Got" is a filler word here with no obvious grammatical or semantic function. "I have to study for my exams" has the same meaning. It is often stressed in speech: "You've just ''got'' to see this."
