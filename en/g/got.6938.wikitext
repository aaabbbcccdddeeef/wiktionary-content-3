'''got'''

# {{simple past of|''[[get]]''}}
#:''We '''got''' the last bus home.''
# {{UK}} {{past participle of|''[[get]]''}}
#:''By that time we'd '''got''' very cold.''
#:''I've '''got''' two children.''
#:'''Usage note:''' The second sentence literally means "At some point in the past I got (obtained) two children", but in "have got" constructions like this the sense of "getting" (obtaining) is lost, and the sentence is in effect synonymous with "I have two children".
