====Usage notes====
* The American and archaic or regional British usage of the verb conjugates as get-got-gotten or as get-got-got depending on the meaning (see [[get#Usage notes|Usage notes on "get"]] for details), whereas the modern general British usage of the verb has largely lost this distinction and normally conjugates as get-got-got in most cases except, sometimes, where the speaker wants to emphasise getting something. ''Gotten'' has also survived in adjectives, especially in ''[[ill-gotten gains]]''. There is an increased usage of ''gotten'' in the UK, which may be due to influence from American films and increased access to American programmes in Britain. However, it is still less common than the get-got-got conjugation.
