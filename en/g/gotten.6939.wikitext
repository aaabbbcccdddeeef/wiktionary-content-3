=====Usage notes=====
The American and archaic or regional dialects of British usage of the verb conjugates as get-got-gotten or as get-got-got depending on the meaning (see [[get#Usage notes|Usage notes on "get"]] for details), whereas the modern British usage of the verb has largely lost this distinction and conjugates as get-got-got in most cases except, sometimes, where the speaker wants to emphasise getting something. There is an increased usage of gotten in the UK, which may be due to influence from American films and increased access to American programmes in Britain. However, it is still less common than the get-got-got conjugation.
