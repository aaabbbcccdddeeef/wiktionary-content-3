===Noun===
{{en-noun|head=[[grand]] [[jury]]|grand juries}}

# {{context|legal|lang=en}} A group of [[citizen]]s assembled by the [[government]] to hear [[evidence]] against an [[accused]], and determine whether an [[indictment]] for a [[crime]] should be brought.
#*'''19 December 2014''', Paul M Farber in {{w|The Guardian}} Online, ''[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/19/die-ins-demand-that-we-bear-witness-to-black-peoples-fears-that-theyll-be-next Die-ins demand that we bear witness to black people's fears that they'll be next]''
#*:Though the current wave of die-ins began after '''grand juries''' in Ferguson and New York City refused to indict the cops who used lethal force against Michael Brown and Eric Garner, they tap into a deep well of what professor Salamishah Tillet calls “civic estrangement” from a state that ignores excessive police violence against black and brown people.
