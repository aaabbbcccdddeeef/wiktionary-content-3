====Usage notes====
While ''get high'' is used to refer to the use of many drugs and intoxicants, it is much more common with certain substances (e.g. {{m|en|marijuana}}) and much less common with others (e.g. {{m|en|alcohol}}). There are numerous substance specific synonyms including {{m|en|get drunk}} pertaining to ''alcohol'', {{m|en|trip}} pertaining to {{m|en|LSD}}, etc. The term is also used figuratively for activities unrelated to drug use, such as exercise (e.g. "I feel great after a long run, that is how I ''get high''.").
