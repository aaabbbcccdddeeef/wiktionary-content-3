====Usage notes====
Dutch lacks words to distinguish ''gender'' from {{m|en|sex}}, using the words {{m|nl|geslacht}} or {{m|nl|sekse}} to encompass both concepts. The term ''gender'' in Dutch has been recently introduced for cases when a clear distinction is needed, such as in the distinction between {{m|en|transgender}} (feeling oneself to be different from one's birth sex) and {{m|en|transsexual}} (having or desiring the sexual organs of the sex opposite to those one had at birth).
