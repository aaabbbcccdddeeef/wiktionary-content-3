==Spanish, Portuguese==
===Etymology===
In both Spanish and Portuguese, a ''gringo'' is a foreigner.  It is believed to originate to from ''[[griego]]'', particularly from the phrase ''hablar en griego'', "to speak in Greek", with a similar connotation to the English phrase "it's all Greek to me".   In this regard, a ''gringo'' is simply someone who speaks an [[unintelligble]] language.

After the [[w:Mexican-American War|Mexican-American War]] and related tensions between the United States and Mexico, this term began to imply United States origin.  However, in most of Latin America, it still simply means "foriegner"; it has been applied for example to Italians living in Argentina, or even Brazilians in Spanish speaking countries, or vice versa.
