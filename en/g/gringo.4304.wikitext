===Etymology===
*In both Spanish and Portuguese, a ''gringo'' is a foreigner. It is believed to originate from ''[[griego]]'', particularly from the phrase ''hablar en griego'', “to speak in Greek”, with a similar connotation to the English phrase “it’s all Greek to me”. In this regard, a ''gringo'' is simply someone who speaks an [[unintelligible]] language.

*Folk etymology suggests that it stems from the English words “Green” and “Grow” in the song “Green Grow the Lylacs” sung by American soldiers during the Mexican-American War.

*After the [[w:Mexican-American War|Mexican-American War]] and related tensions between the United States and Mexico, this term began to imply United States origin. However, in most of Latin America, it still simply means “foreigner”; it has been applied for example to Italians living in Argentina, or even Brazilians in Spanish speaking countries, or vice versa.
