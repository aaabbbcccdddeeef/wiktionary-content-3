# {{italbrac-colon|pejorative}} A [[caucasian]] foreigner, such as an American.  The Spaniards used it to identify people that have a white complexion but who are nevertheless not Spaniards nor of Spanish origin.  The word gringo was commonly used to notify other Spaniards and their descendants that although a gringo may look Spanish or speak Spanish he/she would be from another country that was not Spain, as such they would be considered [[foreigners]].  Morenos or people of darker skin will often make incorrect use of the word gringo to identify a person that is not dark skinned.  This word should not be confused with guero which implies blonde features.

===Etymology===
*In both Spanish and Portuguese, a ''gringo'' is a foreigner. It is believed to originate from ''[[griego]]'', particularly from the phrase ''hablar en griego'', “to speak in Greek”, with a similar connotation to the English phrase “it’s all Greek to me”. In this regard, a ''gringo'' is simply someone who speaks an [[unintelligible]] language.

*Folk etymology suggests that it stems from the English words “Green” and “Grow” in the song “Green Grow the Lilacs” sung by American soldiers during the Mexican-American War.

*After the [[w:Mexican-American War|Mexican-American War]] and related tensions between the United States and Mexico, this term began to imply United States origin. However, in most of Latin America, it still simply means “foreigner”; it has been applied for example to Italians living in Argentina, or even Brazilians in Spanish speaking countries, or vice versa.
