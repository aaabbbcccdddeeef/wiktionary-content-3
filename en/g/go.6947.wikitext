===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{term|gon|lang=enm}}, {{term|goo|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{term|gan|gān|to go|lang=ang}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{recons|gāną||to go|lang=gem-pro}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|ǵʰēh₁-||to leave|lang=ine-pro}}. Cognate with {{etyl|sco|-}} {{term|ga||to go|lang=sco}}, {{etyl|fy|-}} {{term|gean||to go|lang=fy}}, {{etyl|nds|-}} {{term|gan||to go|lang=nds}}, {{term|gahn|lang=nds}}, {{etyl|nl|-}} {{term|gaan||to go|lang=nl}}, {{etyl|de|-}} {{term|gehen||to go|lang=de}}, {{etyl|sv|-}} {{term|gå||to go|lang=sv}}, {{etyl|da|-}} {{term|gå||to go|lang=da}}. Compare also Albanian n{{term|ngaj|gaj|lang=sq||to run}}, Ancient Greek {{term|κιχάνω|tr=kichanō|lang=grc||to meet with, arrive at}}, Avestan {{term||zazāmi}}, Sanskrit {{term||jáhāti}}).<br> Inherited past tense forms (compare {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term|eode|ēode|lang=ang}}), however, have since the 15th century been replaced by forms from {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term|wendan|lang=ang||to go, depart, wend}}; this process is called [[suppletion]].

=====Usage notes=====
* ''Go'', along with {{term|do}}, {{term|make}}, and to a lesser extent other English verbs, is often used as a substitute verb for a verb used previously or one that is implied, in the same way a {{term|pronoun}} substitutes for a {{term|noun}}. For example:
*: ''Chris: Then he '''goes''' like this:'' (Chris waves arms around, implying the phrase means ''Then he moves his arms like this'').

* This cmavo ''go'' is a [[logical connective]] and does not imply causation.
