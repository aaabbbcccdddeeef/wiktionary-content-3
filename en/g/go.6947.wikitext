{{wikipedia|dab=go}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|gon}}, {{m|enm|goon}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|gān||to go}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*gāną||to go}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*ǵʰeh₁-||to leave}}. Cognate with {{etyl|sco|-}} {{m|sco|ga||to go}}, {{etyl|fy|-}} {{m|fy|gean||to go}}, {{etyl|nds|-}} {{m|nds|gan}}, {{m|nds|gahn||to go}}, {{etyl|nl|-}} {{m|nl|gaan||to go}}, {{etyl|de|-}} {{m|de|gehen||to go}}, {{etyl|sv|-}} {{m|sv|gå||to go}}, {{etyl|da|-}} {{m|da|gå||to go}}. Compare also Albanian {{m|sq|ngah||to run, drive, go}}, Ancient Greek {{m|grc|κιχάνω||to meet with, arrive at}}, Avestan {{m|ae||tr=zazāmi}}, Sanskrit {{m|sa|जहाति|tr=jáhāti}}).

The inherited past tense form (compare {{etyl|ang|-}} {{m|ang|ēode}}) was replaced in 15th century by ''went'', from {{etyl|ang|-}} {{m|ang|wendan||to go, depart, wend}}; this process is called [[suppletion]].

=====Usage notes=====
* Along with {{term|do}}, {{term|make}}, and to a lesser extent other English verbs, ''go'' is often used as a substitute for a verb that was used previously or that is implied, in the same way a {{term|pronoun}} substitutes for a {{term|noun}}. For example:
*: ''Chris: Then he '''goes''' like this:'' (Chris then waves arms around, implying that the phrase means ''then he waves his arms'').
