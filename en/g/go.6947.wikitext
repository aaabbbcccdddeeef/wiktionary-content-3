==English==
{{wikipedia|dab=go (verb)|go}}

===Etymology 1===
{{PIE root|en|ǵʰeh₁|wendʰ}}
From {{inh|en|enm|gon}}, {{m|enm|goon}}, from {{inh|en|ang|gān||to go}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*gāną||to go}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*ǵʰeh₁-||to leave}}. The inherited past tense form {{m|en|yode}}, (compare {{cog|ang|ēode}}) was replaced in the 15th century by {{m|en|went}}, from {{cog|ang|wendan||to go, depart, wend}}; this process is called [[suppletion]].

Cognate with {{cog|sco|ga||to go}}, {{cog|fy|gean||to go}}, {{cog|nds|gahn||to go}}, {{cog|nl|gaan||to go}}, {{cog|de|gehen||to go}}, {{cog|sv|-}} and {{cog|da|gå||to go}}, {{cog|no|gå||to walk}}. Compare also {{cog|sq|ngah||to run, drive, go}}, {{cog|grc|κιχάνω||to meet with, arrive at}}, {{cog|ae|𐬰𐬀𐬰𐬁𐬨𐬌}}, {{cog|sa|जहाति|tr=jáhāti}}

=====Usage notes=====
* Some speakers use {{m|en|went}} for the past participle.
* Along with {{m|en|do}}, {{m|en|make}}, and to a lesser extent other English verbs, ''go'' is often used as a substitute for a verb that was used previously or that is implied, in the same way a [[pronoun]] substitutes for a [[noun]]. For example:
*: ''Chris: Then he '''goes''' like this:'' (Chris then waves arms around, implying that the phrase means ''then he waves his arms'').
* * Like other English verbs, the verb ''go'' once had an alternative present participle formed with the suffix ''[[-and]]'', i.e. ''[[goand]]''. ''[[goand|Goand]]'' is now [[obsolete]], having been replaced by ''[[going]]'', except in a few rural dialects in Scotland and Northern England, where it is considered [[archaic]]. Even in such dialects it is never used to form the continuous tenses. These examples are from the Highlands:
*: '''''Goand''' snell athwart the houf, hoo hent 'im be the swyr.'' ('''Going''' swiftly across the churchyard, she grabbed him by the neck.)
*: '''''Goand''' oot of the holt, she saw a woundor baist.'' ('''Going''' out of the woods, she saw a magical creature.)
