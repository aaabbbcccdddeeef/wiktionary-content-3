===Etymology 1===
{{PIE root|en|ǵʰeh₁|wendʰ}}
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|gon}}, {{m|enm|goon}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|gān||to go}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*gāną||to go}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*ǵʰeh₁-||to leave}}. Cognate with {{cog|sco|ga||to go}}, {{cog|fy|gean||to go}}, {{cog|nds|gahn||to go}}, {{cog|nl|gaan||to go}}, {{cog|de|gehen||to go}}, {{cog|sv|gå||to go}}, {{cog|da|gå||to go}}. Compare also Albanian {{m|sq|ngah||to run, drive, go}}, Ancient Greek {{m|grc|κιχάνω||to meet with, arrive at}}, Avestan {{m|ae|𐬰𐬀𐬰𐬁𐬨𐬌|tr=zazāmi}}, Sanskrit {{m|sa|जहाति|tr=jáhāti}}

The inherited past tense form {{m|en|yode}}, (compare {{cog|ang|ēode}}) was replaced in 15th century by ''went'', from {{cog|ang|wendan||to go, depart, wend}}; this process is called [[suppletion]].

=====Usage notes=====
* Some speakers use {{m|en|went}} for the past participle.
* Along with {{m|en|do}}, {{m|en|make}}, and to a lesser extent other English verbs, ''go'' is often used as a substitute for a verb that was used previously or that is implied, in the same way a [[pronoun]] substitutes for a [[noun]]. For example:
*: ''Chris: Then he '''goes''' like this:'' (Chris then waves arms around, implying that the phrase means ''then he waves his arms'').
* The verb '''to go''' has two different present participles (like many other English verbs),i.e. [[going]] and [[goand]]. The form [[goand]] is now [[obsolete]] outside a few (rural) dialects where it is considered [[archaic]]. For example:
*: '''''Goand''' snell athwart the houf.. hoo hent 'im be the swyr :'' ('''Walking''' swiftly across the churchyard.. she grabbed him by the neck).
