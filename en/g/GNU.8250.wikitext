===Etymology===
Coined 1983 by [[w:Richard M. Stallman|Richard M. Stallman]] as a [[recursive acronym]] for "[[w:GNU|GNU]]'s Not Unix", following convention of naming programs similar to or inspired by existing programs as “(New Name) Is Not (Old Name)”; compare {{w|Xinu}}.

Specifically influenced by lack of English words of form ''?inu'' (“?INU Is Not Unix”), that {{term|gnu|lang=en}} is the alphabetically first (and in fact only) English word of the form ''?nu'' (“?’s Not Unix”), that ''gnu'' was perceived as a humorous word, and the existence of the song ''{{w|The Gnu}}''.<ref>[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name "GNU"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006</ref>
