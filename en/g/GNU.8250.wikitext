===Etymology===
Coined 1983 by [[w:Richard M. Stallman|Richard M. Stallman]] as a [[recursive acronym]] for "[[w:GNU|GNU]]'s Not Unix", following convention of naming programs similar to or inspired by existing programs as “(New Name) Is Not (Old Name)”. 

Specifically influenced by lack of English words of form ''?inu'' (“?INU Is Not Unix”), that {{term|gnu|lang=en}} is the alphabetically first (and in fact only) English word of the form ''?nu'' (“?’s Not Unix”), that ''gnu'' was perceived as a humorous word, and the existence of the song ''{{w|The Gnu}}''.<ref>[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name "GNU"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006</ref>
