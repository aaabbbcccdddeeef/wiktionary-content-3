A '''Ghost Train''' is  an excursion done by many [[tourist]] [[railway]]s around the world.  Usually, a [[fiction]]al story is created using local names and places to make the story more believable.  [[Actor]]s and actresses play out the story on the long and narrow stage provided by the railcar aisles.  This provides for a great show as it can be spontaneous and it really gets the [[audience]] into the performance as they are right in the middle of the action. Along the journey there are static displays or live actors on either side of the train.  Music, sound effects, strobe lights, fog machines and the darkness help to set the scenes played out on this moving stage.
