===Etymology===
[[pinyin|Pinyin]] transliteration of {{bor|en|cmn|-}} {{zh-l|廣西|tr=Guǎngxī}}. {{zh-l|廣|tr=guǎng}} itself means "expanse", and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in 226 AD. "Guangxi" and neighbouring [[Guangdong]] literally mean "Guang West" and "Guang East". Together, Guangdong and Guangxi are called the "Two Guangs" ({{zh-l|兩廣}} ''Liǎngguǎng'').

|text=Cadres from minority groups have multiplied rapidly since Liberation. For example, in the early 1950s there were only about nine hundred cadres from minorities in the '''Guangxi'''-Zhuang Autonomous Region. In 1970 there were about seventy-eight thousand. More recent press reports indicate that this trend is continuing.}}

|text=In mid-1917, President Duan Qi-rui took steps to join China’s miniscule might in the Great War of Europe: by declaring war against Germany, he would become eligible for Japanese and other foreign loans and support which could be turned toward building up his army and threatening his competitors with forcible reunification. On the southern side, Lu Rong-ting, the '''Guangxi''' militarist, maneuvered to extend his power; Sun Yat-sen and his supporters in the navy had landed in Canton for yet another attempt at power; and in Fujian, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and elsewhere other warlords were on the outlook for the main chance. Reunification by mere coalition among these ambitious men was the dream of all, but, as all hoped to head the coalition and gain the lion’s share of its spoils, all such schemes were doomed.}}
