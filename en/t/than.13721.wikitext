===Etymology===
In [[etymology]], it represents [[Old English]] ''[[&thorn;anne]]'', which was a variant of ''[[&thorn;onne]]'', meaning "[[then]]". It is therefore [[cognate]] with German ''[[denn]]'' ("than") and ''dann'' ("then"); in Danish the same word ''[[dan]]'' serves for both "then" and "than." It represents the old [[dative case|dative]] or [[instrumental case]] of the pronoun ''[[that]]''.

===Pronunciation===
*(''stressed''): ''th''ăn, /ðæn/, /<tt>D{n</tt>/
*:[[Rhymes:English:-æn|Rhymes: -æn]]
*(''unstressed''): ''th''ən, /ðən/, /<tt>D@n</tt>/

===Conjunction===
'''than'''

# a [[w:grammatical particle|grammatical particle]] and [[preposition]] in the English language. It  introduces a comparison, and as such is associated with [[comparative]]s, and with words such as ''[[more]]'', ''[[less]]'', and ''[[fewer]]''. Typically, it seeks to measure the force of an [[adjective]] or similar description between two [[predicate]]s.

====Usage====
[[w:Prescription (linguistics)|Usage prescriptionists]] have ordained a number of rules concerning ''than'' that. These grammarians deny that ''than'' is a preposition that invariably governs the [[oblique case]], although it has been used as such by writers such as [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], whose 1600 play ''[[w:Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' contains the line:
:''A man no mightier than thyself or me. . .''

and [[w:Samuel Johnson|Samuel Johnson]], who wrote:
:''No man had ever more discernment than him, in finding out the ridiculous.''

In actual usage then, ''than'' functions as both conjunction and preposition; when it is used as a conjunction, it governs the [[nominative case]], and when a preposition, the oblique case.

To determine the [[case]] of a pronoun following "than" observing the prescriptionists’ rules, a writer must look for implied words and determine how they relate to the pronoun.

Examples:

* ''You are a better swimmer than she.''
** represents ''You are a better swimmer than she is.''

therefore ''You are a better swimmer than her'' is a [[solecism]].

* ''They like you more than her.''
** represents ''They like you more than they like her.''

therefore ''They like you more than she'' is a solecism.

It should be noted that prescriptionists insist that the sole form of ''[[who]]'' permitted to follow ''than'' is ''[[whom]]'', despite that according to the above rule, ''who'' would be the correct form. Critics of the prescriptionists often cite this mandatory exception as evidence that the prescriptionist rule is logically erroneous in addition to it being inconsistent with well-established usage.
