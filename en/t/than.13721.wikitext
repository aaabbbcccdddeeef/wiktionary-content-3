===Etymology===
In [[etymology]], it represents {{etyl|ang}} ''[[þanne]]'', which was a variant of ''[[þonne]]'', meaning "[[then]]". It is therefore [[cognate]] with German ''[[denn]]'' ("than") and ''dann'' ("then"); in Danish the same word ''[[dan]]'' serves for both "then" and "than." It represents the old [[dative case|dative]] or [[instrumental case]] of the pronoun ''[[that]]''.

===Preposition===

'''than'''

# introduces a comparison, and is associated with [[comparative]]s, and with words such as ''[[more]]'', ''[[less]]'', and ''[[fewer]]''. Typically, it seeks to measure the force of an [[adjective]] or similar description between two [[predicate]]s.
#: ''Patients diagnosed more recently are probably surviving an average of longer '''than''' two years.''

====Usage notes====
[[w:Prescription (linguistics)|Usage prescriptionists]] have a number of rules concerning ''than''. In formal grammar, ''than'' is not a preposition to govern the [[oblique case]] (although it has been used as such by writers such as [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], whose 1600 play ''[[w:Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' contains the line ''A man no mightier than thyself or me. . .'', and [[w:Samuel Johnson|Samuel Johnson]], who wrote ''No man had ever more discernment than him, in finding out the ridiculous.'').  ''Than'' functions as both conjunction and preposition; when it is used as a conjunction, it governs the [[nominative case]], and when a preposition, the [[oblique case]].  To determine the [[case]] of a pronoun following "than", a writer can look to implied words and determine how they would relate to the pronoun.

Examples :

* ''You are a better swimmer than she.''
** represents ''You are a better swimmer than she is.''
** therefore ''You are a better swimmer than her'' is a [[solecism]].

* ''They like you more than her.''
** represents ''They like you more than they like her.''
** therefore ''They like you more than she'' is a solecism, if it attempts to represent the previous sentence.  It may be correct, however, if it represents ''They like you more than she likes you.''

It must be noted that some prescriptionists insist that ''[[whom]]'' must follow ''than'' (not ''[[who]]''); although according to the above rule, ''who'' would be the "correct" form. Critics of this often cite this mandatory exception as evidence that the prescriptionist rule is logically erroneous, in addition to it being inconsistent with well-established usage.
