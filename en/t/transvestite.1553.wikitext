===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|clinical psychology|psychiatry|pathology}} a person who derives {{l|en|paraphilic}} {{l|en|sexual}} {{l|en|arousal}} and pleasure from wearing clothes that are normally associated with the opposite sex; traditionally restricted to {{l|en|heterosexual}} males who engage in recurrent and persistent {{l|en|cross-dressing}} in feminine dress for the purpose of sexual excitement; in contrast to other forms of cross-dressing, the individual is driven by {{l|en|erotic}} {{l|en|urges}} that are often unwanted to engage in {{l|en|fetishistic}} cross-dressing behaviors that are {{l|en|compulsive}}, causing the patient distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning

====Usage notes====
* This term is relatively formal (Latinate); {{m|en|cross-dresser}} is more casual, but whereas the verb {{m|en|cross-dress}} is common, the verb {{m|en|transvest}} is quite rare.
* ''Transvestite'' should not be confused with {{m|en|transgender}} (see that term for more); transvestites are often happy with their gender and have no desire to change their sex, but simply enjoy being able to cross-dress from time to time. When speaking of to or about an individual who identifies as transgender, the term transvestite is typically seen as derogatory.
* The term should also not be confused with {{m|en|drag queen||person who performs femininity}} or {{m|en|drag king||person who performs masculinity}}; those terms are specifically for performers.
* The primary clinical definition is far more restrictive than its colloquial usage and much more distinct if not entirely exclusive from that of a ''drag queen''—who are often {{m|en|homosexual}} males who choose to engage in cross-dressing for entertainment purposes. The psychiatric condition of a ''transvestite'' has in the [[w:International Classification of Diseases|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) and in editions of the [[w:Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) been variously called simply {{m|en|transvestism|Transvestism}} (DSM-III), {{m|en|Fetishistic Transvestism}} (ICD-10), {{m|en|Transvestic Fetishism}} (DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR), and {{m|en|Transvestic Disorder}} (DSM-5).
