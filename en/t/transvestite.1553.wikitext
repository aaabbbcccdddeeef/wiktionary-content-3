===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# A person who sometimes wears [[clothes]] traditionally worn by and associated with the opposite [[sex]]; typically a male who cross-dresses occasionally for sexual gratification by habit or compulsion. Most all male transvestites dress for sexual gratification. The clothing is the fetish or turn on that release the pleasure endorphins. Most all of these Men are Bisexuals with a small percentage of them being gay or straight. What makes them trans - vest is a strong sexual enjoyment from the state of being dressed. Endorphins are released and it is very much like a morphine release. Dressing is addictive and incredibly hard to control. Buying sprees with purges soon to follow are the norm. In the past this was considered a mental health issue, it is now looked at as something that is accepted. Dr. studies found that NO kind of treatment shock therapy, drugs or analysis had any effect on curing or stopping the patient from this activity. Dr. studies also found their was no definitive conclusion as to why the Men gravitated towards dressing in Women's clothing. There are many degrees of dress from simply wearing Women's panties to full dress with make and hair. It's considered a minor activity in todays society and has become some what accepted. It's considered now just to be a sexual fetish that brings no real harm to the dresser. BUT if it becomes a problem then it's a problem. You may want to discuss with it someone qualified. 


   

====Usage notes====
* This term is relatively formal (Latinate); {{m|en|cross-dresser}} is more casual, but whereas the verb {{m|en|cross-dress}} is common, the verb {{m|en|transvest}} is quite rare.
* ''Transvestite'' should not be confused with {{m|en|transgender}} or {{m|en|transsexual}} (see those terms for more); transvestites are often happy with their gender and have no desire to change their sex, but simply enjoy being able to cross-dress from time to time.  When speaking of to or about an individual who identifies as transgender, the term transvestite is typically seen as derogatory.
* The term should also not be confused with {{m|en|drag queen||male who wears women’s clothing for public performance}}; that term is specifically for performers.
