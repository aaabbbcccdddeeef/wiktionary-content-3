===Noun===
'''transvestite''' (''plural'' '''transvestites''')

#A person who likes to wear [[clothes]] and act in a style traditionally displayed by the opposite [[gender]]. This is done on an occasional basis; transvestites do not generally dress in the opposite [[gender]] all the time. The term "transvestite" should not be confused with the term "[[transsexual]]", which refers to someone who lives permanently in the opposite [[gender]] to that which they were born in. Transvestites do not wish to change their gender, but simply enjoy playing the role of the other [[gender]] from time to time.
<!--
#A '''transvestite''' is a person who voluntarily wears clothes of a gender that is not the gender assigned (usually) at birth or the gender a person currently lives in. Usually, but not exclusively, the term refers to male bodied and/or male identified persons.<br/><br/>However, the words transvestitism and transvestite have many often conflicting connotations. For a discussion of the history and current usage of the term transvestite, see [[w:transvestitism]].<br/><br/>Transvestites and transvestite behaviour are part of [[transgender]]. Transvestites do not cross-dress for primary sexual reasons; cross-dressing primary for sexual reasons is called transvestic fetishism.
