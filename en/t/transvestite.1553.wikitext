'''transvestite''' (''plural'' '''transvestites''')

# A Cross-dresser, i.e., a person who sometimes wears [[clothes]] traditionally worn by and associated with the opposite [[sex]]. This is generally done on an occasional basis by habit or compulsion; transvestites do not typically cross-dress all the time. 

====Note====

The term "transvestite" should not be confused with the term "[[transsexual]]", which refers to someone who lives full time (or virtually so) as the opposite [[sex]] of that in which they were born. Transvestites generally have less desire to permanently change their sex, but simply enjoy being able to cross-dress from time to time.  Others may aspire to live as the opposite sex but defer or decline to for economic, social, religious or other reasons.

In usage, "transvestite" most often implies a male who dresses in the clothing of a girl or woman, carries a strong sexual overtone, and is considered by many to be sexually unusual, [[fetishistic]], "[[kinky]]", [[deviant]] or sick. 

<!--
#A '''transvestite''' is a person who voluntarily wears clothes of a gender that is not the gender assigned (usually) at birth or the gender a person currently lives in. Usually, but not exclusively, the term refers to male bodied and/or male identified persons.  <br/><br/>However, the words transvestitism and transvestite have many often conflicting connotations. -->
