'''transvestite''' (''plural'' '''transvestites''')

# A Cross-dresser, i.e., a person who sometimes wears [[clothes]] traditionally worn by and associated with the opposite [[sex]]. This is generally done on an occasional basis by habit or compulsion; transvestites do not typically cross-dress all the time. 

====Note====

The term "transvestite" should not be confused with the term "[[transsexual]]", which refers to someone who lives full time (or virtually so) as the opposite [[sex]] of that in which they were born. Transvestites generally have less desire to permanently change their sex, but simply enjoy being able to cross-dress from time to time.  Others may aspire to live as the opposite sex but defer or decline to for economic, social, religious or other reasons.

In usage, "transvestite" most often implies a male who dresses in the clothing of a girl or woman, carries a strong sexual overtone, and is considered by many to be sexually unusual, [[fetishistic]], "[[kinky]]", [[deviant]] or sick.   This is most likely for the reason that in Western society it is considerably more common and acceptable for women to emulate and aspire to be like men, than for men to emulate women.  Though it is common for women to privately borrow and wear the attire of a man for emotional reasons, from the late 1960's on it has become increasingly common for women to do so for reasons of practicality or fashion.  Many trends in women's [[couture]] are inspired by the look of men's business and formal wear, and women are not thought sexually deviant or even unusual for openly purchasing articles of mens or boys clothing and wearing them in public.

#A '''transvestite''' is a person who voluntarily wears clothes of a gender that is not the gender assigned (usually) at birth or the gender a person currently lives in. Usually, but not exclusively, the term refers to male bodied and/or male identified persons.  <br/><br/>However, the words transvestitism and transvestite have many often conflicting connotations. -->

'''Related Terms'''

Transvestites may or may not cross-dress out of emotional or sexual need; Cross-dressing primarily for emotional or sexual reasons has also been termed "transvestic fetishism".   Transvestites and transvestism (transvestite behaviour) are also treated as a sub-category of [[transgender]] [people] (''cf.'' transgenderists and transgenerism).
