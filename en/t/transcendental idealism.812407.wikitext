'''[[transcendental]] [[idealism]]'''
#A branch of [[philosophy]] first proposed by [[Immanuel Kant]] (see [[Kantianism]]). It deals with the [[ethic of reciprocity]] and can be juxtaposed with [[transcendental realism]] in that it views things in terms of how they appear to the [[actor]] rather than how they actually are.
