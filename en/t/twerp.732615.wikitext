===Etymology===
Of uncertain origin. The Oxford English Dictionary writes that it may have been coined (perhaps by {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien}}) around 1910 from the name of T. W. Earp. However, the Dictionary of American Slang writes that it was in use in 1874. It may be a dialectal variant of ''[[dwarf]]'' (compare Middle English ''dwerf'', Low German ''[[Twarg]]''); it ma alsoy derive from the onomatopoeia ''[[twirp]]''.
The word was used to denote a type of racing pigeon that flew between [[Antwerp]] and [[London]] c. 1870 [see "The Odd Facts of Life" – Bill Hooper, published in 1965]. It may also be related to the Welsh ''twp'', a fool.
