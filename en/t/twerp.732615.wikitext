===Etymology===
Of uncertain origin. The Oxford English Dictionary writes that it may have been coined (perhaps by {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien}}) around 1910 from the name of T. W. Earp. However, the Dictionary of American Slang writes that it was in use in 1874. It may be a form of ''[[dwarf]]'' (compare Low German ''[[Twarg]]''). It may derive from the onomatopoeia ''[[twirp]]''.
