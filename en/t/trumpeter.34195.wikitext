{{en-noun}}

# A person, especially male, who plays the [[trumpet]].

====Usage notes====
When piston cornets were introduced, a distinction was made between a person who played an old fashioned valve-less trumpet (a '''trumpeter''') and a musician who played a ''Cornet-á-pistons'' (a '''trumpet player.''')  This distinction is mostly lost today, as the standard Bb trumpet is so much more prevalant than any museum-piece valve-less trumpet.
