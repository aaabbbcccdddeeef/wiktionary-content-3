====Usage notes====
* In a few informal [[sociolect]]s, the past form {{m|en|took}} is sometimes replaced by the [[proscribed]] form {{m|en|taked}}.
* Similarly, the participle {{m|en|taken}} is sometimes replaced by the equally [[proscribed]] {{m|en|tooken}}.
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun ''[[thou]]'' was in active use, and verbs used ''[[-est]]'' for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb ''take'' had the form ''[[takest]]'', and had ''[[tookest]]'' for its past tense.
* Similarly, when the ending ''[[-eth]]'' was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form ''[[taketh]]'' was used.
