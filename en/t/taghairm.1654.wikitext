Note I. {{...}} The Highlanders, like all rude people, had various superstitious modes of enquiring into futurity. One of the most noted was the '''''Taghairm''''', mentioned in the text. A person was wrapped in the skin of a newly slain bullock, and deposited beside a water-fall, or at the bottom of a precipice, or in some other strange, wild, and unusual situation, where the scenery around him suggested nothing but objects of horror. In this situation he revolved in his mind the question proposed, and whatever was impressed upon him by his exalted imagination, passed for the inspiration of the disembodied spirits, who haunt these desolate recesses.}}
## A method of divination in which [[cat]]s were [[roast#Verb|roasted]] [[alive]] to call up the [[spirit#Noun|spirit]] of the [[demon]] cat who would grant the wishes of the [[torturer]]s.
