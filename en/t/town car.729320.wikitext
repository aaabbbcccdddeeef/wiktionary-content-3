{{en-noun}}

# A relatively small [[motor car]], of only moderate performance but with reasonable fuel economy, intended for use mostly in [[urban]] areas
# No, other than being a car, and therefore, a noun, it isn't anything stated above in #1.  It was the largest car produced in the US until production ceased in 2011 due to the lack of interest in huge cars that use enormous amounts of gas.  Now, it is used as a rental that is one step down from a limousine, and similarly, it comes with a driver. See Lincoln Town Car, Wikipedia.
