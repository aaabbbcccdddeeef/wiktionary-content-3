===Etymology===
Indian vernacular word (eg. Gujarati ''taku'', or Marathi ''take'' (please improve these transliterations or replace them by the proper words)) for a large artificial water reservoir (cistern, pool, etc.), via Portuguese ''[[tanque]]'', "tank", "liquid container". Also, Arabic has a verb ''istanqa`a'' = "it (= a liquid) collected and became stagnant".

In the sense of armoured vehicle, to disguise their nature, prototypes were described as tanks for carrying water (1915).
