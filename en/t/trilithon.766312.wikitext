#* '''1846''', Edward Duke, ''The Druidical Temples of the County of Wilts'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=KrYHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA159&dq=%22trilithon%22%7C%22trilithons%22%7C%22trilitha%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLnubr243WAhUO52MKHTN3BuUQ6AEItAEwGg#v=onepage&q=%22trilithon%22%7C%22trilithons%22%7C%22trilitha%22&f=false page 158],
#*: {{...}}thus the two opposite '''trilithons''' which are nearest to the north-west or grand entrance, were 19 feet in height, the two next opposite '''trilithons''' correspond in the height of 20 feet 3 inches, and the '''trilithon''' at the back of the stone of astronomic observation, or as erringly called the Altar-stone, raised its ascent to the astonishing height of 25 feet.
#* '''1983''', Hans van der Laan, ''Architectonic Space: Fifteen Lessons on the Disposition of the Human Habitat'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rPQycVUjn90C&pg=PA193&dq=%22trilithon%22%7C%22trilithons%22%7C%22trilitha%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLnubr243WAhUO52MKHTN3BuUQ6AEIkwEwFA#v=onepage&q=%22trilithon%22%7C%22trilithons%22%7C%22trilitha%22&f=false page 193],
#*: The two '''trilithons''' forming the wall on each side of the cella therefore pass on the mutual neighbourhood to each other, despite the fact that they are set a slight distance apart. But owing to the oblique placing of the pair of '''trilithons''' nearest the head-end the spread is greatly reduced on that side; the head-'''trilithon''' stands at the exact spot where it ceases.

#*: Within the sarsen circle are the five impressive '''trilithons''', forming a horseshoe-shaped ring of huge stones.

#*: {{...}}whereas the four-square gallows would have been more likely to suggest to his contemporary Blake, who normally used symbolism for its own sake, a resemblance to one of the four-square '''trilitha''' at Stonehenge.
