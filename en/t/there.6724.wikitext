===Etymology===
Middle English '''[[ther]]''' < Old English '''[[þær]]''' < Proto-Germanic '''[[*þær]]''' < Proto-Indo-European '''[[*tar-]]''' ("there") < PIE demonstrative pronominal base '''[[*to-]]''' ("the", "that") + adverbial suffix '''-r'''.
*Akin to Dutch [[daar]], German [[da]], Old High German [[dār]], Swedish [[där]], Danish [[der]], Icelandic and Gothic [[þar]], Sanskrit [[tarhi]] (then), and English [[that]]. See '''[[that]]''' (pronoun).

#*The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and '''there''' he put the man whom he had formed. — ''Genesis 2:8''
#: '''Note:''' In distinction from [[here]], '''there''' usually signifies a place farther off, in such a manner, that [[here]] would include the person using the word, while '''there''' would not.
#*Darkness '''there''' might well seem twilight '''here'''. — [[Milton]]
# In that matter, relation, etc.; at that point, stage, etc., regarded as a distinct place; as, he did not stop '''there''', but continued his speech.

#: '''Note''': '''There''' is sometimes used by way of exclamation, calling attention to something, especially to something distant; as, '''There, there'''! See '''there'''! Look '''there'''! '''There''' is often used as an expletive, and in this use, when it introduces a sentence or clause, the verb precedes its subject.
