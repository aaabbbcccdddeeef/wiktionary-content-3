====Usage notes====
* The use of ''there'' instead of [[they're]] (meaning ''they are'') is a common error in English writing.
* {{sense|to or into that place}}
** ''There'' is sometimes used by way of exclamation, calling attention to something, especially to something distant; such as in the phrases '''There, there'''! See '''there'''! Look '''there'''!
** ''There'' is often used as an expletive, and in this use, when it introduces a sentence or clause, the verb precedes its subject.
** ''There'' is much used in composition, and often has the sense of a pronoun. See {{m|en|thereabout}}, {{m|en|thereafter}}, {{m|en|therefrom}}, etc.

====Usage notes====
* In formal English, the verb agrees with the semantic subject: “there is a tree”, “there are some trees”, “there seems to be a mistake”, “there seem to be some mistakes”, and so on. This is because the "there [form of be]" construction originally used, and could still be said to use, "there" as simply an adverb modifying "to be". However, the syntax is archaic enough that "there" is rarely recognized as an adverb. In colloquial usage, therefore, the verb is often found in the third-person singular form, even when the semantic subject is plural — “there’s some trees”, “there seems to be some mistakes” — but this is often considered incorrect.
