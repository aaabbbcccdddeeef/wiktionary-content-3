|passage=She had a twin sister named Heidi and neither '''Trudi''' or Heidi liked their names. They were the names (in the opinion of Heidi and '''Trudi''') of goat-herding girls and American hookers, of girls who wore their hair in plaits and drank milk or had sex dressed as French maids and nurses. Of girls who never grew up. '''Trudi''' and Heidi had no idea why they were so called.}}
