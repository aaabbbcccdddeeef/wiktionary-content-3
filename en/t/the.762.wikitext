{{rel-top|pronunciation notes}}
The word ''the'' is commonly pronounced /ðiː/ whenever it is pronounced as a distinct word, e.g.:
* When it is used for emphasis (''This is ''the'' hospital for heart surgery.'').
* When the speaker pauses between ''the'' and the next word (''the … sovereignty'').
* In many but not all dialects, when the next word begins with a vowel sound {{qualifier|the onion}} (compare with [[a]] vs. [[an]]).
<!--no: this is not true: * When referred to as a word (''the word “the”''). -->
The word is generally pronounced indistinctly as /ðə/ or merely /ð/ in other situations, such as when attached to a word beginning with a consonant sound. <!--well, ''thus'' and ''th' U.S.'' are different in many ways, neither really including a glottal stop — In dialects that do not pronounce ''the'' distinctly before a vowel, a glottal stop is generally inserted (e.g., ''the US'' in ''the US festival'' would still be pronounced differently from ''thus'' in ''thus festival seating should be outlawed'').-->
{{rel-bottom}}
{{rel-top|"the" vs. "ye"}}
* The [[eye dialect|typographical pronunciation]] /jiː/ (''"'''[[ye#Etymology_2|Ye]]''' Old..."'') is a deliberately archaic [[retronym]] from {{m|en|ye|ẏe|sc=Latinx}}, which is a variant spelling of [[þe]], from Old English [[þe#Old English|þē]] pronounced '''''thē''''', /ðeː/ (using [[ẏ]] in place of the [[thorn]] ([[þ]]). It is not actually a separate pronunciation in Middle English.
* The actual [[morpheme]] /jiː/ in Middle English represents [[ȝe-]], a variant spelling of the prefix [[y-]] attached to [[verb]]s and used to denote a verbal [[past participle]].

<!-- 1 syllable words !-->

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|the}}, from {{inh|en|ang|þē||the, that|pos=[[demonstrative pronoun]]}}, a late variant of {{m|ang|sē}}. Originally masculine nominative, in Middle English it superseded all previous Old English forms ({{m|ang|sē}}, {{m|ang|sēo}}, {{m|ang|þæt}}, {{m|ang|þā}}), from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*sa}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*só}}.

==Crimean Gothic==

===Etymology===
From {{inh|gme-cgo|gem-pro|*sa}}.

===Article===
{{head|gme-cgo|article}}

# [[#English|the]]
#* 1562, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq:
#*: omnibus vero dictionibus praeponebat articulum tho aut '''the'''
#*: [he/she] placed the article tho or '''the''' before every word

====Usage notes====
While it is likely that Crimean Gothic retained grammatical gender, de Busbecq's letter does not mention which articles are used with which words, making it impossible to reconstruct their gender.
