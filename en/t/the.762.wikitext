===Etymology===
Built on Old English [[demonstrative pronoun]]s: [[þe#Old English|þe]], a late variant of [[se#Old English|se]], originally masculine nominative, but in Middle English superceding all previous Old English forms ([[se#Old English|se]], [[seo|sēo]], [[þæt]]).

===Definite article===
'''the'''

# Definite [[w:grammatical article|grammatical article]] that implies necessarily that the entity it articulates is presupposed; something already assumed as existing. Compare ''I'm reading '''a''' book'' with ''I'm reading '''the''' book''.
#: '''''The''' word "the" is the most common word in the English language.''
#: '''''The''' men, '''the''' women, '''the''' boy and '''the''' girl watched '''the''' man give '''the''' birdseed to '''the''' bird.''
# When stressed, indicates that the object in question is considered to be the best or the only one worthy of attention.
#: ''That is ''the'' hospital to go to for heart surgery.''
# With an adjectival noun, indicates all persons to whom the adjectival noun applies.
#: ''Feed '''the''' hungry, clothe '''the''' naked, comfort '''the''' afflicted, and afflict '''the''' comfortable.''
# With a {{superl}}, indicates the person or thing to which the superlative applies.
#: ''That apple pie was '''the''' best.''
# Used as an alternative to a [[possessive pronoun]] before body parts.
#: ''A stone hit him on '''the''' head.'' ( = "A stone hit him on his head.")
<!-- It can also be used as a [[w:possessive pronoun|possessive pronoun]], as in "can't walk right since the ankle went";-->
<!-- I doubt this is quite what's going on: "So, you can't walk right since the ankle went?" This usage is very close to ''that''-->
# Used with the name of a member of a class to refer to all things in that class.
#: '''''The''' cat is a solitary creature.'' ( = "All cats are solitary creatures.")

<!--''The'' can also mean "sufficient", as in "lacked the gumption to make his move".-->
<!-- No, this is OK without ''the'', though this usage is less common -->
<!-- as an expression of a [[w:ratio|ratio]], as in "five apples the dollar"; -->
<!-- First, this sounds odd to me, or at least dated. Second, ''a/an'' serves in similar situations, notably ''five miles an hour''. I would say that ''the dollar'' here is idiomatic, not rule-based, but I could be wrong. -->

====Usage notes====
The word ''the'' is pronounced /ðiː/ whenever it is pronounced as a distinct word, e.g.:

* When it is used for emphasis (''This is ''the'' hospital for heart surgery.'').
* When the speaker pauses between ''the'' and the next word (''the ... sovereignity'').
* In many but not all dialects, when the next word begins with a vowel (''the onion'') (compare with [[a]] vs. [[an]]).
<!--no: this is not true: * When referred to as a word (''the word "the"''). -->

The word is generally not pronounced distinctly when attached to a word beginning with a consonant, in which case the ''e'' becomes a [[schwa]] or is dropped entirely. In dialects that do not pronounce ''the'' distinctly before a vowel, a glottal stop is generally inserted (e.g., ''the Us'' in ''the Us festival'' would still be pronounced differently from ''thus'' in ''thus festival seating should be outlawed'').
