{{rel-top|pronunciation notes}}
The word ''the'' is commonly pronounced /ðiː/ whenever it is pronounced as a distinct word, e.g.:
* When it is used for emphasis (''This is ''the'' hospital for heart surgery.'').
* When the speaker pauses between ''the'' and the next word (''the … sovereignty'').
* In many but not all dialects, when the next word begins with a vowel sound {{qualifier|the onion}} (compare with [[a]] vs. [[an]]).
<!--no: this is not true: * When referred to as a word (''the word “the”''). -->
The word is generally pronounced indistinctly as /ðə/ or merely /ð/ in other situations, such as when attached to a word beginning with a consonant sound. <!--well, ''thus'' and ''th' U.S.'' are different in many ways, neither really including a glottal stop — In dialects that do not pronounce ''the'' distinctly before a vowel, a glottal stop is generally inserted (e.g., ''the US'' in ''the US festival'' would still be pronounced differently from ''thus'' in ''thus festival seating should be outlawed'').-->

{{rel-top|"the" vs. "ye"}}
* The [[eye dialect|typographical pronunciation]] /jiː/ (''"'''[[ye#Etymology_2|Ye]]''' Old..."'') is a deliberately archaic [[retronym]] from {{term|ye|ẏe|lang=en|sc=Latinx}}, which is a variant spelling of [[þe]], from Old English [[þe#Old English|þē]] pronounced '''''thē''''', /ðeː/ (using [[%E1%BA%8F]] in place of the [[thorn]] ([[þ]]). It is not actually a separate pronunciation in Middle English.
* The actual [[morpheme]] /jiː/ in Middle English represents [[%C8%9De-]], a variant spelling of the prefix [[y-]] attached to [[verb]]s and used to denote a verbal [[past participle]].

====Usage notes====
While it is likely that Crimean Gothic retained grammatical gender, de Busbecq's letter does not mention which articles are used with which words, making it impossible to reconstruct their gender.
