====Usage notes====
For the number of occurrences and the ratio of comparison, ''[[once]]'' and ''[[twice]]'' are typically used instead of ''one time'' and ''two times''. ''[[thrice|Thrice]]'' is uncommon but not obsolescent, and is still common in Indian English.<ref>James Lambert, 2012, 'Diachronic stability in Indian English lexis' ''World Englishes'' Vol. 31, issue 1, page 112-127. [https://doi.org/10.1111/weng.12072]</ref>
