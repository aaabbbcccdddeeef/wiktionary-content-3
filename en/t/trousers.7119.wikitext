===Etymology===
Attested since the 1610s, from the earlier form ''trouzes'' (attested since the 1580s), extended from ''trouse'' (1570s), with plural ending typical of things in pairs, from {{etyl|mga|en}} {{term|triubhas||close-fitting shorts|lang=mga}}, of uncertain origin. The unexplained intrusive second -r- is perhaps due to the influence of ''drawers''.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trousers Etymology] of trousers in [[:w:Online Etymology Dictionary|Online Etymology Dictionary]]</ref>

#* {{RQ:Wodehouse Offing|XIX|The effect the apparition had on me was to make me start violently, and we all know what happens when you start violently while holding a full cup of tea. The contents of mine flew through the air and came to rest on the '''trousers''' of Aubrey Upjohn, MA, moistening them to no little extent. Indeed, it would scarcely be distorting the facts to say that he was now not so much wearing '''trousers''' as wearing tea. [...] “I see you have not changed since you were with me at Malvern House,” he said in an extremely nasty voice, dabbing at the '''trousers''' with a handkerchief. [...] “Frightfully sorry,” I said. “Too late to be sorry now. A new pair of '''trousers''' ruined. It is doubtful if anything can remove the stain of tea from white flannel.”}}
#: ''Why can women wear '''trousers''' when men can't wear skirts?''
