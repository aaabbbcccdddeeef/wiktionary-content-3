===Etymology===
Attested since the 1610s, from the earlier form ''trouzes'' (attested since the 1580s), extended from ''trouse'' (1570s), with plural ending typical of things in pairs, from {{etyl|mga|en}} {{m|mga|triubhas||close-fitting shorts}}, of uncertain origin. The unexplained intrusive second -r- is perhaps due to the influence of ''drawers''.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trousers Etymology] of trousers in [[:w:Online Etymology Dictionary|Online Etymology Dictionary]]</ref>

#* {{RQ:Wodehouse Offing|chapter=XIX|passage=The effect the apparition had on me was to make me start violently, and we all know what happens when you start violently while holding a full cup of tea.
