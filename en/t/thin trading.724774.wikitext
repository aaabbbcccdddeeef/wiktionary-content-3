'Thin trading' is a stockmarket phrase used to describe the lower trading frequency commonly observed with lesser known companies and firms listed on the markets. Due to various reasons, such as the size of the firm and the degree of market capitalisation, certain firms may not be as well-known and closely monitored by analysts and investors and, as a result, the shares of that company will not have the same market depth as some other well-known firms. 

Thinly traded companies offer a higher level of investment opportunity and risk for investors. Due to the relatively lesser monitoring of the company, the market for these companies will not be as efficient and so wary investors may be able to take advantage of this lag to generate higher rates of return. On the other hand, these companies are noticeably less transparent and offer less public information causing difficulty in projecting accurate future projections.
