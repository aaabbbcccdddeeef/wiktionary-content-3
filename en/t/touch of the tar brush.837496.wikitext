This is a somewhat dated term believed to be of British origin, used to describe somebody of [[Multiracial|mixed racial heritage]].

To say somebody had "a touch of the tar brush" signified suspicion of a "coloured" ancestor, most commonly (though not exclusively) of [[South Asia|South Asian]] or [[Afro-Caribbean]] denomination. The phrase was used either as an observation upon the colour of the skin or the appearance/arrangement of the facial features, sometimes both. It was not an expression generally used for those that were unambiguously and distinguishably biracial (of two racial categories in equal amount). More often it referred to those for whom evidence of mixed ethnic attributes were perceptibly more subtle.

Since the expression is deemed to be fairly derogatory in overtone, even considered by some to be unequivocally [[Racist|racist]], it is seldom used today.
