===Etymology===
believed to be of British origin

===Phrase===
{{head|en|phrase|head=[[touch]] of the [[tar]] [[brush]]}}

# {{context|idiomatic|lang=en}} Pertaining to somebody of [[mixed]] [[racial]] [[heritage]]; to signify someone is commonly (though not exclusively) of [[Afro-Caribbean]] or, to a lesser extent [[South Asian]] in their background and/or in their appearance.

===Usage notes===
It was not generally used for people that were unambiguously and distinguishably biracial. More often it referred to those for whom evidence of mixed ethnic attributes were perceptibly more subtle.

Since the expression is deemed to be fairly derogatory in overtone, even considered by some to be unequivocally [[racist]], it is seldom used today.
