#*: Madame Eskimoff's '''tweeny''' had brought out tea and a gâteau, as well as a twelve-year-old Speyside malt and glasses.

# {{pop culture}} an [[18-20 year old]], underclassman college-aged young adult.  These teens think that their three major philosophy courses, gramatical know how, and mastery of trigonometry make them prepared to spew their beliefs for all to hear in public forums, especially pubs and taverns & often illegally under the influence of alchohol, through the use of "fake-IDs."  Tweenies frequent 18& up clubs, Starbucks, and Liberal voting booths, where their age old wisdom can decide the future of your country.  Scary but true, and we all know we are jealous of their vibrant attempts at destructing their own purity and becoming "adults" in the traditional sense, as this all-too-short period of our lives lies emblazzoned heavily on our minds forever in all of it's glory.
