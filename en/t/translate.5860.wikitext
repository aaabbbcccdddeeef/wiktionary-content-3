===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*telh₂-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|translaten|t=to move something from one place to another; to transfer; to disinter (a body); to relocate (a saint's relics); to take captive, deport or exile; to destroy; to alter the location of; to change allegiance; to adopt new customs or laws; to transfer sovereignty from one ruler or people to another; to transfer property or rights; to remove; to assume into heaven; to alter, transform; to replace; to translate from one language into another}}{{nb...|transelate, tranlate, translat, translate, transulate, traunslate|otherforms=1}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=translāten|pos=v|id=MED46784}}</ref> and then from:

* {{der|en|xno|tranlater}}, {{m|fro|translater}}, and {{der|en|frm|-}}, {{der|en|fro|translater|t=to translate from one language into another; to move something from one place to another; to transfer a bishop from one see to another; to relocate (a saint's relics)}} (modern {{cog|fr|translater}}); and

''Trānslātus'' is derived from {{m|la|trāns-|pos=''prefix meaning ‘beyond’''}} + {{m|la|lātus|t=borne, carried}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*telh₂-|t=to bear, endure; to undergo}}), the {{glossary|irregular}} perfect passive participle of {{m|la|ferō|t=to bear, carry}}. The English word is cognate with {{cog|ca|traslladar|t=to transfer}}, {{cog|ga|trasladar|t=to move something from one place to another; to transfer; to translate}}, {{cog|it|traslatare}}, {{cog|LL.|translatare|t=to translate from one language into another; to transfer a bishop from one see to another; to relocate (a saint's relics); to transcribe}}, {{cog|pro|transladar}}, {{m|pro|translatar}}, {{m|pro|traslatar}}, {{cog|pt|transladar}}, {{m|pt|trasladar|t=to move something from one place to another; to translate}}, {{cog|es|trasladar}}, {{m|es|transladar|t=to move; to transfer; to translate; to copy, transcribe; to transmit}}.<ref name="OED"/>

The word displaced {{noncog|enm|awenden|t=to change; to translate}} (from {{noncog|ang|āwendan}}), {{noncog|enm|irecchen|t=to explain, expound, interpret}} (from {{noncog|ang|ġereċċan}}), and {{noncog|ang|ġeþēodan|t=to engage in; to translate}}.

====Usage notes====
* ''Translation (sense 1.1)'' is often used loosely to describe any act of conversion from one language into another, although formal usage typically distinguishes {{m|en|interpretation}} as the proper term for conversion of [[speech]].
* While translation attempts to establish equivalent [[meaning#Noun|meaning]] between different texts, the conversion of text from one [[orthography]] to another (attempting to roughly establish equivalent [[sound#Noun|sound]]) is distinguished as {{m|en|transliteration}}.
* [[literal|Literal]], [[verbatim]], or [[word-for-word]] translation ([[metaphrase]]) aims to capture as much of the exact expression as possible, while [[loose]] or free translation, or [[paraphrase]], aims to capture the general sense or artistic affect of the original text. At a certain point, text which has been too freely translated may be considered an [[adaptation]] instead.
