====Usage notes====
* ''Translation (sense 1.1)'' is often used loosely to describe any act of conversion from one language into another, although formal usage typically distinguishes {{m|en|interpretation}} as the proper term for conversion of [[speech]].
* While translation attempts to establish equivalent [[meaning#Noun|meaning]] between different texts, the conversion of text from one [[orthography]] to another (attempting to roughly establish equivalent [[sound#Noun|sound]]) is distinguished as {{m|en|transliteration}}.
* [[literal|Literal]], [[verbatim]], or [[word-for-word]] translation ([[metaphrase]]) aims to capture as much of the exact expression as possible, while [[loose]] or free translation, or [[paraphrase]], aims to capture the general sense or artistic affect of the original text. At a certain point, text which has been too freely translated may be considered an [[adaptation]] instead.
