'''Telecottage''' is the name given to a [[teleworker]]'s physical [[workplace]].  The telecottage can be in the individual's home or, as is becoming increasingly the case, on a communal site within a short walking distance of the teleworker's home.

The degree of technology employed in a telecottage depends on the teleworker's duties and overall resources.  For example, a self-employed teleworking architect could work from an [[office]] which has nothing more than a drawing desk and a [[fax]].  However whilst the teleworker's paraphernalia can be limited, certain economies can be counterproductive especially if these home-based workers are unable to compete due to shortcomings in their equipment.  It is therefore no surprise to learn that the bulk of teleworking is centring on [[personal computer|PC]]-based systems.
