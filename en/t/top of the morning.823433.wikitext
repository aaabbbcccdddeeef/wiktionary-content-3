The term has long been associated with Ireland, however it appears never to have been a popular, or commonly used phrase in Ireland.

# {{lb|en||New England|idiomatic|archaic}} A generic [[greeting]] said to someone in the [[morning]].

====Usage notes====
This term should be considered [[apocryphal]] of Irish speech and is a [[stereotype]]. While popularly used in the United States when imitating Irish people, or when celebrating one's Irish heritage (e.g. on St. Patrick's day), latter-day native Hiberno-English speakers would be unlikely to ever use this phrase. See [[Hollywood Irish]].
