==English==

===Alternative forms===
* {{m|en|top o' the mornin'}}

===Etymology===
A working-class phrase apparently once abundant throughout the {{w|British Isles}} in the {{w|Victorian era}} (not especially notable amongst the Irish {{m|en|vis-a-vis}} other peoples of the Isles), but was perhaps preserved slightly longer with the Irish and {{w|Irish diaspora}}. Possibly connected to a notion of fresh unhomogenised milk, where the desirable cream rises to the top (compare {{m|en|cream of the crop}} and {{m|en|creme de la creme}}), and thus wishing the listener to have an excellent day. Revived into popular consciousness, and associated with Irishmen, by American filmmakers in early 20th cent. movies like 1959's ''{{w|Darby O'Gill and the Little People}}''; see more at the [https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/51427/what-is-the-origin-of-the-phrase-top-of-the-morning-to-you| StackExchange discussion here].

Hypothesized connection to some old Celtic phrase is wanting.

====Usage notes====
This term should be considered [[apocryphal]] of Irish speech and is a [[stereotype]]. While popularly used in the United States when imitating Irish people, or when celebrating one's Irish heritage (e.g. on {{w|St. Patrick's Day}}), latter-day native Hiberno-English speakers would be unlikely to ever use this phrase. See [[Hollywood Irish]].
