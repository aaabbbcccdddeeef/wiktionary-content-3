===Etymology===
Origins {{unk.}}; circa 1940s; thought to be a reference to [[Dear John letter]]s

If you search and search for this phrase you will often come across stories of World War II service members that received the dumping letters commonly called Dear John Letters. While the stories about Dear John Letters go all the way back to the beginning of our involvement in the war, the phrase “that’s all she wrote” didn’t start to appear in connection to these letters until about 1945.  However there is a much earlier event that took place in 1942 that plainly uses the phrase, “that’s all she wrote”.  In April 1942 Ernest Tubb, dubbed the Texas Troubadour, recorded a song entitled That’s All She Wrote published by the American Music Inc of Hollywood.
