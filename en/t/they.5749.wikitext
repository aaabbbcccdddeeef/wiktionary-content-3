===Etymology===
The term was borrowed by {{etyl|enm|en}} (as {{term|they|lang=enm}}, {{term|thei|lang=enm}}) in the 1200s from {{etyl|non|en}} {{term|þeir|lang=non}}, the nominative plural masculine of the demonstrative {{term|sá|lang=non}}, which acted in Old Norse as a plural pronoun. The Norse term derives from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{term/t|gem-pro|*þai||those}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{term/t|ine-pro|*to-||}}. It gradually replaced Old English {{term/t|ang|hī}} and {{term/t|ang|hīe||they}}.

Cognate to {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term/t|ang|sc=Latinx|þā||those}} (whence Modern English {{term|tho|lang=en}}), {{etyl|sco|-}} {{term|thae|lang=sco}}, {{term|thai|lang=sco}}, {{term|thay||they; those|lang=sco}}, Icelandic {{term|þeir||they|lang=is}}, {{etyl|fo|-}} {{term|teir||they|lang=fo}}, Swedish {{term|de||they|lang=sv}}, Danish {{term|de||they|lang=da}}, Norwegian {{term|de||they|lang=no}}, {{etyl|nn|-}} {{term|dei||they|lang=nn}}, and {{etyl|de|-}} {{term|die||the; |pos=plural article and pronoun|lang=de}}. See also {{l|en|tho}}.

The term has been used as a singular pronoun since at least the 1400s.
