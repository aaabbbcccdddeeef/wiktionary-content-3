==Twerking==

===History===

Invented in the early 90's in a mental institute by the coast of Jamaica, when a young lady had a severe illness which included unexpected muscle spasms. The doctors called it "Twerk", the art to shake the bum bum, from the latin word "twerkosorise", used by Ceaser when demanding a lap dance.

The ratchet people came along and began doing it at their ghetto bonfires of burning garbage, it has now moved up north to Canada and is a very common dance in clubs and parties. The art of shaking the bum bum, or as people would say, Twerking, is a disgusting way of dancing, and should not be used by pre-mature children, or anyone in general.

So please refrain from doing the "Twerk". It may cause dangerous side effects, like: pre-mature ejaculation, enlargement of the bum area, back pain and much more.
