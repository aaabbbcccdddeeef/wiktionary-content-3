==English==

===Etymology===
A quotation from the Lakota leader Crazy Horse, who shouted "Hóka-héy!" meaning (loosely), "Today is a good day to die!"

Actually Hoka-Hey means something along the lines of "let's go". Not it is a good day to die. Although "it is a good day to die" is only part of the quote attributed to Crazy Horse.

===Phrase===
{{head|en|phrase|head=[[today]] [[is]] [[a]] [[good]] [[day]] [[to]] [[die]]}}
# An expression of willingness and even eagerness to give one's life in the name of one's cause.
# A belief that one should never live a moment of one's life with any regrets, or tasks left undone. Which would make today as good a day as any to die.
