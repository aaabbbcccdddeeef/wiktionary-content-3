===Etymology===
A quotation from the Sioux leader Crazy Horse, who shouted "Hóka-héy, today is a good day to die!" meaning (loosely), "Let's do this, today is a good day to die!" Often incorrectly thought to be a famous saying translated from the Siouan language.

===Phrase===

# An expression of willingness and even eagerness to give one's life in the name of one's cause.
