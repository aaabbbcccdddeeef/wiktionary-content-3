===Etymology===
{{rfc|lang=en}}
A quotation from the Lakota leader Crazy Horse, who shouted "Hóka-héy!" interpreted (loosely), "Today is a good day to die!"

Actually "Hóka-héy" means something along the lines of "Let's go", not "It is a good day to die". Although "It is a good day to die" is only part of the quote attributed to Crazy Horse.

===Phrase===

# An expression of willingness and even eagerness to give one's life for one's cause.
# One should never live a moment of one's life with any regrets, or tasks left undone.
# "Klingon locution, often uttered when the odds see to favor an opponent. It does not, however, represent a defeatist attitude. Quite the contrary, in a society in which warriors are so revered, to die in a battle is a noble aspiration." (Marc Okrand, ''The Klingon Way'', Pocket Books, New York 1996, p. 69)
