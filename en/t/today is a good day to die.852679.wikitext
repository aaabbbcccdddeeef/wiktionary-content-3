===Etymology===
{{rfc|lang=en}}
A quotation from the Lakota leader Crazy Horse, who shouted "Hóka-héy!" meaning (loosely), "Today is a good day to die!"

Actually Hoka-Hey means something along the lines of "let's go". Not it is a good day to die. Although "it is a good day to die" is only part of the quote attributed to Crazy Horse.

===Phrase===
{{head|en|phrase}}

# An expression of willingness and even eagerness to give one's life for one's cause.
# One should never live a moment of one's life with any regrets, or tasks left undone.
