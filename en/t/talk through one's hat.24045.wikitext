==English==

===Etymology===
Attested from the late 19th century in the {{w|United States}} in the sense of “bluff”; the sense “speak without authority or knowledge” developed later. Although some people speculate a connection to a former requirement that British Members of Parliament wear hats, the connection is implausible.
