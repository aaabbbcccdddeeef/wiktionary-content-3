Technocentcrism, as coined by Seymour Papert (1987) refers to "the fallacy of referring all questions to technology."  In an educational context, learning goals should precede the application of technology, not the reverse.

"I coined the word technocentrism from Piaget's use of the word egocentrism. This does not imply that children are selfish, but simply means that when a child thinks, all questions are referred to the self, to the ego. Technocentrism is the fallacy of referring all questions to the technology."
