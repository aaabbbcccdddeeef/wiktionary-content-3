#* '''1998''', Allen Mitchie, ''Between Calvin and Calvino: Postmodernism and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress'', Greg Clingham (editor), ''Questioning History: The Postmodern Turn to the Eighteenth Century'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Vpsgmt6V2OkC&pg=PA54&dq=%22tropology%22%7C%22tropologies%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WqAwVdDbOcLAmwWht4CQCA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22tropology%22%7C%22tropologies%22&f=false page 54],
#*: But she is not right to claim this is because "rhetoric" must necessarily be "in the Nietzschean sense that all language is founded in '''tropology'''."<sup>37</sup> Since when has '''tropology''' been in conflict with theology? '''Tropology''' and rhetoric thrive in the works of both Calvin and Calvino, and '''tropology''' is the very lifeblood of ''The Pilgrim's Progress''.
# {{lb|en|theology|philosophy}} The interpretation of scripture or other work in order to educe moral or figurative meaning; a treatise of such interpretation.

#* '''2009''', Frank Ankersmit, ''2: White's "New Neo-Kantianism": Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics'', Frank Ankersmit, Ewa Domanska, Hans Kellner (editors), ''Re-Figuring Hayden White'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=U-vpxr3v39QC&pg=PA37&dq=%22tropology%22%7C%22tropologies%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WqAwVdDbOcLAmwWht4CQCA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22tropology%22%7C%22tropologies%22&f=false page 37],
#*: A similar story can be told for White's '''tropology'''. '''Tropology''' also is something that “the mind brings” to (past) reality and that is not part of the past itself.
# A recurring [[motif]] or metaphor, a [[trope]]; an [[interplay]] of tropes.
#* '''1994''', Lee Edelman, preface, ''Homographesis'', hardcover edition, page xiv,
#*: These essays, in other words, endeavor to read the literary, cultural, and political implications of the '''tropologies''' of sexuality that are put into play once the field of sexuality becomes charged by the widespread availability of a "homosexual" identity, and they explore the determining relation between "homosexuality" and "identity" as both have been constructed in modern Euro-American societies.

It is a '''tropology''' of equality above all else—of antihierarchy, antiprivilege, and antiauthoritarianism—one in which human relations both ethical and political are symmetrically structured in principle, if not always in fact, and every person counts for no more or less than one.}}

====Usage notes====
The countable interpretation of the sense ''the use of a trope'' is ''an instance of something being used as a trope'', which is indistinguishable from {{m|en|trope}}.
