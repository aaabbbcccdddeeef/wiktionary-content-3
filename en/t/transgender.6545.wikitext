{{en-adj}}

# Pertaining to someone who does not identify with conventional categories of [[male]] or [[female]], but combines elements of both or moves between the two; sometimes used as a general, inclusive term, and sometimes as synonymous with or opposed to more specific terms such as {{term|transsexual}}, {{term|transvestite}} etc.
#*'''1998''', John Cloud, "Trans across America", ''Time'', 20 Feb 1998:
#*:Their first step was to reclaim the power to name themselves: '''transgender''' is now the term most widely used, and it encompasses everyone from cross-dressers (those who dress in clothes of the opposite sex) to transsexuals (those who surgically "correct" their genitals to match their "real" gender).
#*'''2010''', Jessica Green, "I'm sorry, I'm not lesbian", ''The Guardian'', 3 Mar 2010:
#*:One head of a small gay charity visibly flinched when I mentioned my boyfriend and has been cold towards me ever since. I've even caught someone staring down my top to see if I'm '''transgender'''.
#*'''2010''', Natasha Lennard, "City Room", ''New York Times'', 7 Apr 2010:
#*:But the inclusion of the word “trannie” — a pejorative, in some circles — in the title, and the film’s parodic representation of '''transgender''' women, has offended many people.
