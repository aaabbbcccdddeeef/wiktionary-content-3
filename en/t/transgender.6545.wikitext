[...] Transsexuals constitute a subset of transgender people."</ref> and popularized in the late 1970s,<ref name="Dict">{{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{R:Merriam-Webster Online}}</ref> and by the 1990s it had largely displaced the older, narrower term {{m|en|transsexual}}.<ref name="TR2006">''Transgender Rights'' (2006, {{ISBN|0816643121}}, edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M.

====Usage notes====
* In Western countries, many transgender people consider the use of ''transgender'' (and similar adjectives) as a noun to be offensive, and several guides advise against such usage.<ref>[http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender GLAAD media reference guide]:<br>Problematic: "transgenders," "a transgender"<br>Preferred: transgender people, a transgender person<br>''Transgender'' should be used as an adjective, not as a noun. Do not say, "Tony is a transgender," or "The parade included many transgenders." Instead say, "Tony is a transgender man," or "The parade included many transgender people."</ref><ref>[http://handbook.reuters.com/?title=T#transgender Reuters ''Handbook of Journalism'']: Do not use transgender as a noun; no one should be referred to as “a transgender.”</ref><ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-t Guardian and Observer style guide]: use transgender [...] only as an adjective: transgender person, trans person; never "transgendered person" or "a transgender"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171222083800/http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/news-style-guide/article/art20130702112133564 BBC News style guide]: "Do not say 'transsexuals', in the same way we would not talk about 'gays' or 'blacks'."</ref> "A transgender man" (for a man who was assigned to the female sex at birth) or "a transgender woman" (for the reverse) is frequently more appropriate.
