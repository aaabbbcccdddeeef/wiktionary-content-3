====Usage notes====
* ''That'' can be used to introduce subordinate clauses, but can just as easily be omitted: one can say either "he told me '''that''' it's a good read" (in which case the second clause is a "''that'' clause") or "he told me it's a good read" (in which case the second clause is a "bare clause").
* Historically, "that" was usually preceded by a comma ("he told me, that it is a good read") — such usage was, for example, recommended by the grammarian Joseph Robertson in his 1785 essay ''On Punctuation'' — but this is now generally considered nonstandard.

====Usage notes====
* Some authorities prescribe that ''that'' should only be used in restrictive contexts (where the relative clause is part of the identification of the noun phrase) and ''[[which]]'' or ''[[who]]''/''[[whom]]'' should be used in non-restrictive contexts; in other words, they prescribe "I like the last song on the album, which John wrote". In practice, both ''that'' and ''which'' are found in both contexts.<ref name="MWO">{{R:Merriam Webster Online}}</ref>
* In a restrictive relative clause, ''that'' is never used as the object of a preposition unless the preposition occurs at the end of the clause; ''[[which]]'' is used instead. Hence "this is the car I spoke of" can be rendered as "this is the car that I spoke of" or "this is the car of which I spoke", but not as *"this is the car of that I spoke."
* ''That'' refers primarily to people or things; ''which'' refers primarily to things, and ''who'' refers primarily to people. Some authorities insist ''[[who]]''/''[[whom]]'' be used when making reference to people, but others, such as the ''Merriam-Webster'' dictionary, write that such prescriptions are "without foundation" and use of ''that'' in such positions is common and "entirely standard".<ref name="MWO"/> Hence, one sees both "he is the man who invented the telephone" and "he is the man that invented the telephone."
* When ''that'' (or another relative pronoun, like ''[[who]]'' or ''[[which]]'') is used as the subject of a relative clause, the verb agrees with the antecedent of the pronoun. Thus "The thing that is...", "The things that are...", etc.
