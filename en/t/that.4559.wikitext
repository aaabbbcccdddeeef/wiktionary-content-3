====Usage notes====
* ''That'' can be used to introduce subordinate clauses, but can just as easily be omitted: one can say either "he told me '''that''' it's a good read" (in which case the second clause is a "''that'' clause") or "he told me it's a good read" (in which case the second clause is a "bare clause").
* Historically, "that" was usually preceded by a comma ("he told me, that it is a good read") — such usage was, for example, recommended by the grammarian Joseph Robertson in his 1785 essay ''On Punctuation'' — but this is now generally considered nonstandard.
* Historically, ''that'' was sometimes used after a preposition to introduce a clause that was the object of the preposition, as in "after that things are set in order here, we'll follow them" (Shakespeare, ''1 Henry VI''), which simply means "after things are set in order..." and would be worded thus in modern English.<ref>''The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'' (1903)</ref><!--see talk page for Century's entry-->

====Usage notes====
* Some authorities prescribe that ''that'' should only be used in restrictive contexts (where the relative clause is part of the identification of the noun phrase) and ''[[which]]'' or ''[[who]]''/''[[whom]]'' should be used in non-restrictive contexts; in other words, they prescribe "I like the last song on the album, which John wrote". In practice, both ''that'' and ''which'' are found in both contexts.<ref name="MWO">{{R:Merriam Webster Online}}</ref>
* In a restrictive relative clause, ''that'' is never used as the object of a preposition unless the preposition occurs at the end of the clause; ''[[which]]'' is used instead. Hence "this is the car I spoke of" can be rendered as "this is the car ''that'' I spoke of" or "this is the car of which I spoke", but not as *"this is the car of ''that'' I spoke."
* ''That'' refers primarily to people or things; ''which'' refers primarily to things, and ''who'' refers primarily to people. Some authorities insist ''[[who]]''/''[[whom]]'' be used when making reference to people, but others, such as the ''Merriam-Webster'' dictionary, write that such prescriptions are "without foundation" and use of ''that'' in such positions is common and "entirely standard".<ref name="MWO"/> Hence, one sees both "he is the man who invented the telephone" and "he is the man that invented the telephone."
* When ''that'' (or another relative pronoun, like ''[[who]]'' or ''[[which]]'') is used as the subject of a relative clause, the verb agrees with the antecedent of the pronoun. Thus "The thing that is...", "The things that are...", etc.
* In the past, bare ''that'' could be used, with the meaning "the thing, person, etc indicated", where modern English requires ''that which'' or ''what''. Hence the King James translation of John 3:11 is "We speak ''that'' we do know, and testify ''that'' we have seen" while the New International Version has "we speak ''of what'' we know, and we testify ''to what'' we have seen".
