{{infl|en|phrase|head=[[the|The]] [[rain]] [[in]] [[Spain]] [[fall]]s [[mainly]] [[in]] [[the]] [[plain]]}}

# {{dated}} A phrase traditionally used to demonstrate differences of pronunciation in various English dialects of the sound represented by the [[digraph]] ''ai''.

This is actually a pharse frequently mistaken with the lyrics [[the|The]] [[rain]] [[in]] [[Spain]] [[stay]]s [[mainly]] [[in]] [[the]] [[plain]] from the 1964 movie My fair lady. The gramatically correct form is either the originally line or The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain. So this entry is gramatically incorrect.
