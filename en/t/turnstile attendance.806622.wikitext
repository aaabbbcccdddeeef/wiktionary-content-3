AKA turnstile figures. A term used to by event organizers to give a rough figure of the number of attendees for multiple day events. Basically instead of counting the actual number of attendees on any given day which would be a difficult task, they count the number of days of access each individual has been granted. An attendee sold a one day pass would count as one, a two day pass would count as two and so on. Organizers have no way of knowing if an attendee is present for each day they have access which is why its considered a rough but reliable estimate. In this method an event with 10,000 attendees each sold a 3 day pass would be said to have 30,000 turnstile attendance.
