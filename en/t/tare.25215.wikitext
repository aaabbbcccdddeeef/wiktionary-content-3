===Etymology===
From {{etyl|la|ro}} {{term|tālem|lang=la}}, accusative of {{term|tālis|lang=la}}. The sense of "distinguished" or "so great/excellent" in Latin probably eventually became "strong" in earlier Romanian, finally taking on the more literal meaning of "hard" or "tough". Cf. also {{term|atare|lang=ro}}.
