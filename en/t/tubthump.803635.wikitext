# To aggressively attract attention for something
#* '''2003''', Janet Wasko, ''How Hollywood Works'', page 233
#*: '''tubthump''' to promote or draw attention to, from the ancient show business custom of actors wandering the streets banging on tubs to drum up business.
#* '''2004''', Martin Rowson, ''And Another Thing...: The Book of Rants'', page 2
#*: Yet I was pleasantly surprised to discover that some celebs can '''tubthump''' with the best of them. Who'd have thought that Julia Roberts would take a career-damaging swipe at her own government.
