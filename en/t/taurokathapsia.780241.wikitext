'''taurokathapsia'''
#[[bull-leaping]], as depicted in Bronze Age art, especially from Minoan Crete.

====Etymology====
Learned formation from Greek [[ταυροκαθάψια]], a certain ritual bull-fight held in Thessaly (also [[ταυροκάθαψις]]), from ταυρος ("bull") and κάθαψις, a rare abstract noun composed of [[κατα]] "across" and [[ἅπτομαι]] "touch, reach", thus literally "touching of the bull". Apparently coined by Arthur Evans, the excavator of Knossos, in ca. 1910.
