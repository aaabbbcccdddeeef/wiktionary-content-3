===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# One who has undergone hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and/or [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS).

====Usage notes====
The attributive use of ''transsexual'' as an adjective is sometimes regarded by transsexual people as inappropriate, as this may detract from the primacy of their gender identity. Example: ''"I am a transsexual woman."'' Likewise, ''transman'' and ''transwoman'' primarily refer to any transgender persons; transsexual persons may or may not identify as transgender or adopt such terms.  Slang usage such as ''transie'', ''tranny'', and ''shemale'' may also refer to either transgender or transsexual persons, but are considered pejorative by some people.

The use of the word transsexual as a noun is also often regarded by TS people as highly inappropriate as it detracts from the primacy of their actually being a person.
Example: "I am a transsexual person". This may however be subject to regional variation in the same way that it is considered acceptable in parts of South Africa to refer to someone as "a black" as opposed to "a black person" or "a black woman".

In everyday usage, if you have to use the "T" word it is most appropriate to use it as an adjective. The fact someone may have a transexual background is an aspect of them and is not the thing that most defines them.
