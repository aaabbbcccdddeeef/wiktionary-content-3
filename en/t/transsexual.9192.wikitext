===Etymology===
{{prefix|trans|alt1=Trans-|sexual|lang=en}}. Introduced to English along with {{m|en|transsexualism}} by {{w|David Oliver Cauldwell}} in 1949, based on the {{etyl|de|en}} word {{m|de|Transsexualismus}} coined by {{w|Magnus Hirschfeld}} in 1923. Popularized in the mid 1960s, around the same time that {{m|en|transgender}} was coined;<ref name="Bevan">Thomas E. Bevan, ''The Psychobiology of Transsexualism and Transgenderism'' (2014, {{ISBN|1440831270}}, page 42: "The term transsexual was introduced by Cauldwell (1949) and popularized by Harry Benjamin (1966) [...]. The term transgender was coined by John Oliven (1965) and popularized by various transgender people [... including] many transgender people [who] advocated the use of the term much more than Prince. [...] Transsexuals constitute a subset of transgender people."</ref> ''transgender'' had become an umbrella term and largely but not entirely displaced ''transsexual'' by the 1990s.<ref name="TR2006">''Transgender Rights'' (2006, {{ISBN|0816643121}}, edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M. Juang, Shannon Minter; page 4: "From signifying a subject position between cross-dresser and transsexual, the meaning of ''transgender'' expanded radically in the early 1990s to include them, along with other cross-gender practices and identities."</ref>

===Adjective===
{{en-adj}}

# {{lb|en|of a person}} Having changed, or being in the process of changing, physical sex (because it does not match desired sex) by undergoing medical treatment such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and optionally [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS), or rarely only SRS.

====Usage notes====
* Although some authors<!--e.g. Harry Benjamin; see [[w:Transgender]] for more--> distinguish ''transsexual'' (pertaining to physical [[sex]]) and ''transgender'' (pertaining to [[gender]]), ''transgender'' is generally taken to encompass ''transsexual'' and has largely displaced it; ''transsexual'' is now often considered outdated, although some people who have undergone [[SRS]] still prefer it; compare the usage notes at ''[[transgender]]''.<ref>{{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref> Neither term should be confused with {{m|en|transvestite}} (which see for more).<ref name="Bevan"/><ref name="TR2006"/><ref name="GLAADmrg">[http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender GLAAD media reference guide]</ref>

#*: Hundreds of women every year are taken completely by surprise when their husbands announce they want to undergo sex-change surgery — and the news is even more shocking when comes, as it often does, from a burly he-man who’d given no clue to his inner girl. ¶ But the signs are definitely there if your husband is dreaming of becoming a '''transsexual''', says a new study by a top sexologist.

#*: Being a '''transsexual''' is not something that can be ignored or suppressed forever. Unlike the fascinations of the cross dresser or the partially altered transgenderist, the absolute compulsion of classical transsexualism is a matter of life and death.
