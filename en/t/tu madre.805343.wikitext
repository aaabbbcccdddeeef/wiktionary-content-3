# {{pejorative|slang|lang=es}} Similar to the English version, a catch-all retort; shut the fuck up.  Literally: [[your mom]].

#:''Tu madre.''

====Usage notes====
The mother has a more sacred place in Hispanic culture, and invoking one's mother can carry more immediately negative consequences than might be the case in English-speaking countries depending on the specific person and relationship.
