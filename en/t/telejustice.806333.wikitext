'''Telejustice''' refers to using two-way interactive video for conducting [[judicial]] proceedings. Using technology for this purpose allows judges to monitor behavior of those individuals on [[probation]], permits crime victims to testify at parole hearings without traveling to a meeting where an inmate is present, and provides an alternative to inmates traveling to court for parole hearings.
