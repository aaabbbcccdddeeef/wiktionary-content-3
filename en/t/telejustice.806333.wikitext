Telejustice refers to using two-way interactive video for conducting judicial proceedings.  Using technology for this purpose allows judges to monitor behavior of those individuals on probation, permits crime victims to testify at parole hearings without traveling to a meeting where an inmate is present, and provides an alternative to inmates traveling to court for parole hearings.
