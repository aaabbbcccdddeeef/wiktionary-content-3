[[File:Chrysallis virgata virgata 01.JPG|thumb|<center>''Chrysallis virgata virgata''<br>is a subspecies of the species ''Chrysallis virgata''. The fact that the third name in the trinomen is the same as the second suggests that it is the first form described, or a "typical" ''Chrysallis virgata''</center>]]
[[File:Chrysallis virgata dryas 1.JPG|thumb|<center>Giving ''Chrysallis virgata dryas'' a different third name in the trinomen may suggest (but does not guarantee) that it differs from specimens originally  described as ''Chrysallis virgata''. Here the colour pattern contrasts with ''Chrysallis virgata virgata''.]]</center>

# {{lb|en|taxonomy|zoology}} A [[scientific name]] at the rank of [[subspecies]]: an expansion of a [[binomial name]] (a [[genus]] and a [[species]]) combined with the name of the subspecies; for example  ''Anopheles gigas formosus'' or ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''.
#*:The subspecies (trinomen) is the only infraspecific taxon so recognized by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature... However, the category of subspecies has not been widely used in entomology, because, in most cases, the level of population differentiation within a species is not clearly determined and subspecies populations are difficult to identify.<ref name="KimMcPheron1993">Ke Chung Kim, Bruce A.
