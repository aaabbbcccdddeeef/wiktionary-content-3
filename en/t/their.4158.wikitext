For centuries, ''their'' has been used with a singular antecedent; however, many condemn this usage for its violation of traditional agreement rules.  Writers should only use this construction if they are sure it will be viewed as an intentional choice, rather than an error. See [[w:Singular_they|singular they]] for a more in-depth discussion.
