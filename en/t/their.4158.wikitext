====Usage notes====
* For notes on the usage referring to a person of unspecified gender, see the usage notes for '''[[they]]'''.
* It is important to distinguish “'''their'''” from “[[there]]” and “[[they're|they’re]]”. “'''Their'''” signifies ownership. “There” designates a place (compare ''here''). “They’re” means “they are”.
* It should also be noted that this is an exception of the "I before E, except after C" rule, as the combination of "ei" in the middle of the word is not after a "c".

====Related terms====
* [[they]], [[them]] (personal pronouns, subject & object case)
* [[theirs]] (possessive pronoun)
