===Etymology===
{{suffix|en|twelve|ty}}, from {{inh|en|ang|hundtwelftiġ}}. Compare {{m|ang|hundseofontiġ}}, {{m|ang|hundeahtatig}}, {{m|ang|hundniġontiġ}} and {{m|ang|hundtēontiġ}} for modern {{m|en|seventy}}, {{m|en|eighty}}, {{m|en|ninety}} and {{m|en|one hundred}}, reflecting the old Germanic hybrid base-ten and base-twelve numbering system. This {{m|ang|hund}} was used for counting higher [[decade]]s, and eventually became the root of {{m|en|hundred}}. {{m|ang|hund|Hund}} originally meant 120 (now called a {{m|en|long hundred}} or {{m|en|great hundred}}, and preserved in the term {{m|en|hundredweight}}), but was used to translate multiples of Latin {{m|la|centum||100}}, and eventually picked up that value when used in isolation as well.

|passage=Minbari use base 11, not base 10, so twelve would be eleventy-first year, and so on. Minbari base eleven includes fingers and head, from which the principle of mathematics comes. […] Eleventy-seven = Eighteen base ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Eleventy-one, eleventy-two, eleventy-three, eleventy-four, eleventy-five, eleventy-six, eleventy-seven, eleventy-eight, eleventy-nine, eleventy-ten, '''twelfty'''.

And so on. Who here still has a problem with this?}}
