===Alternative forms===
* [[twelvety]]

===Etymology===
* {{suffix|twelve|ty}}
* From {{etyl|ang|en}} {{term|hundtwelftig|lang=ang}}. Compare {{term|hundseofontig|lang=ang}}, {{term|hundeahtatig|lang=ang}}, {{term|hundnigontig|lang=ang}} and {{term|hundteontig|hundtÄ“ontig|lang=ang}} for modern {{term|seventy|lang=en}}, {{term|eighty|lang=en}}, {{term|ninety|lang=en}} and {{term|hundred|lang=en}}, reflecting the old Germanic hybrid base-ten and base-twelve numbering system. This {{term|hund|lang=ang}} was used for counting higher [[decade]]s, and eventually became the root of {{term|hundred|lang=en}}. {{term|hund|Hund|lang=ang}} originally meant 120 (now called a {{term|long hundred|lang=en}} or {{term|great hundred|lang=en}}, and preserved in the term {{term|hundredweight|lang=en}}), but was used to translate multiples of Latin {{term|centum||100|lang=la}}, and eventually picked up that value when used in isolation as well.
