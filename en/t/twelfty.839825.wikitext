* [[twelvety]]

===Etymology===
* {{suffix|twelve|ty}}
* From {{etyl|ang}} {{term|hund-twelftiᵹ}} Compare ''hund-seofontiᵹ, hund-eahtatiᵹ, hund-niᵹontiᵹ,'' and ''hund-téontiᵹ'' for modern ''[[seventy]], [[eighty]], [[ninety]],'' and ''[[hundred]],'' reflecting the old Germanic hybrid base-ten and base-twelve numbering system. This ''hund'' was used for counting higher [[decade]]s, and eventually became the root of "[[hundred]]". [[Hund]] originally meant 120 (now called a ''[[long hundred]]'' or ''[[great hundred]],'' and preserved in the term ''[[hundredweight]]''), but was used to translate multiples of Latin ''[[centum]]'' (100), and eventually picked up that value when used in isolation as well.
