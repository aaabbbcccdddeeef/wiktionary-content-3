===Etymology 1===

===Etymology 2===
From [[Old English]] ''hund-twelftiᵹ.'' Compare ''hund-seofontiᵹ, hund-eahtatiᵹ, hund-niᵹontiᵹ,'' and ''hund-téontiᵹ'' for modern ''[[seventy]], [[eighty]], [[ninety]],'' and ''[[hundred]],'' reflecting the old Germanic hybrid base-ten and base-twelve numbering system. It is not clear how this ''hund-'' was related to the root ''hund'' "[[hundred]]", which originally meant 120 (now called a ''[[long hundred]]'' or ''[[great hundred]],'' and preserved in the term ''[[hundredweight]]).''
