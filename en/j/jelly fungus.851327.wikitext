#*: ''Tremella fuciformis'' is a tropical and subtropical '''jelly fungus''' found on hardwood logs after heavy rains.

====Usage notes====
'''Jelly fungi''' were formerly included in the (now obsolete) [[paraphyletic]] grouping [[Heterobasidiomycetes]], but are now spread among several [[class]]es: [[Tremellales]], [[Dacrymycetales]], [[Auriculariales]] and [[Sebacinales]]. The grouping Heterobasidiomycetes is still used informally.
