#*: In Cenxi county, south of Wuzhou on a tributary ﬂowing into the West River, the local gazetteer even assigned a speciﬁc date to the introduction of double cropping of rice: “Planting an early crop of rice ﬁrst began during the Tianqi reign (1621–27), [and after that] each year two crops were harvested. The early crop is planted at '''Jingzhe''' [“Waking of the Insects”, March 5] and harvested in Xiaoshu or Dashu [“Lesser” or “Greater Heat”, July 7–23]. The late crop is planted at Mengzhong [“Grain in the Ear”, June 6] and harvested in the ﬁrst month of the winter [mid-November].”<sup>73</sup>

#*: In Shanghai, popular beliefs such as the idea that a thunderstorm prior to '''Jingzhe''' (the Waking of Hibernation, third solar period) foretells a bad year, eating many watermelons after Liqiu (the Beginning of Autumn, thirteenth solar period) may cause typhoid, tonics are most efficacious if taken after Dongzhi (the Winter Solstice, twenty-second solar period), and so on remained powerful in the twentieth century.
