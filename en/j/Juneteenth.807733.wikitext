The significance of the day is so great and the tales I have collected are so bound up with the legalized slavery which, in 1865, this day put an end to, that I have used '''''Juneteenth''''' as a title. Nobody who does not understand a '''Juneteenth''' celebration can ever understand the Negro or his songs and tales.}}
