* '''1895'''— [[w:H. G. Wells|H. G. Wells]], ''[[s:The Wheels of Chance|The Wheels of Chance]]'', ch XII
*: Anon Mr. Hoopdriver found himself riding out of the darkness of non-existence, pedalling Ezekiel's Wheels across the Weald of Surrey, jolting over the hills and smashing villages in his course, while the other man in brown cursed and swore at him and shouted to stop his career. There was the Putney heath-keeper, too, and the man in drab raging at him. He felt an awful fool, a- -what was it?--a juggins, ah!--a '''Juggernaut'''.
