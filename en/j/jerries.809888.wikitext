==English==
Jerries are the British version of Germans. Just like how Americans called Germans Krauts during WWII. Jerries is the exact same thing. It comes from the fuel can that the Germans carried around, the British people saw these "Jerry Cans' and hence the name Jerries. 

It is a shortened version of Germans, but "Germs" is harder to say than Jerries.
