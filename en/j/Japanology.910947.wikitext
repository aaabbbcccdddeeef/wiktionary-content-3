Japanology is the study of Japan. Japanology and Japanese studies are terms generally used in Europe to describe the historical and cultural study of Japan; in North America, the academic field is usually referred to as Japanese studies, which includes contemporary social sciences as well as classical humanistic fields.

European Japanology is the study of language, culture, history, literature, art, music, science, etc. Its roots may be traced back to the Dutch at Dejima, Nagasaki in the Edo period. The foundation of the Asiatic Society of Japan at Yokohama in 1872 by men such as Ernest Satow and Frederick Victor Dickins was an important boost to this fledgling academic discipline which has since grown into an internationally respected field.
