#* {{RQ:Authorized Version|Job|42|13-15}}:
#*: He had also seven sons and three daughters. And he called the name of the first, '''Jemima'''; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch. And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
#* '''1853''' {{w|Elizabeth Gaskell}}, ''Ruth'', Chapter XVII:
#*: -- and at last '''Jemima''' was fixed upon, because it would do either for a Scripture name or for a heroine out of a book."
#*: "I did not know '''Jemima''' was a Scripture name," said Ruth.
#*: "Oh yes, it is. One of Job's daughters; '''Jemima''', Kezia, and Keren-Happuch. There are a good many '''Jemimas''' in the world, and some Kezias, but I never heard of a Keren-Happuch; and yet we know just as much of one as of another. People really like a pretty name, whether Scripture or out of it."
#* '''2005''' {{w|Zadie Smith}}, ''On Beauty'', Penguin (2006), {{ISBN|9780141026664}}, page 51:
#*: But then, thought Kiki, they were brought up that way, these white American boys: I'm the Aunt '''Jemima''' on the cookie boxes of their childhoods, the pair of thick ankles Tom and Jerry played around. Of course they find me funny.

====Usage notes====
* Jemima has largely fallen out of use in North America due to the association with advertising character {{w|Aunt Jemima}}, interpreted as a racial stereotype of African-Americans. See {{m|en|Aunt Jemima}}.
