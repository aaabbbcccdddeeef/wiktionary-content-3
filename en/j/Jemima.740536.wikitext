===Quotations===
'''1853''' Elizabeth Gaskell: ''Ruth''. Chapter XVII
::-- and at last '''Jemima''' was fixed upon, because it would do either for a Scripture name or for a heroine out of a book."
::"I did not know '''Jemima''' was a Scripture name," said Ruth.
::"Oh yes, it is. One of Job's daughters; '''Jemima''', Kezia, and Keren-Happuch. There are a good many '''Jemimas''' in the world, and some Kezias, but I never heard of a Keren-Happuch; and yet we know just as much of one as of another. People really like a pretty name, whether Scripture or out of it."
