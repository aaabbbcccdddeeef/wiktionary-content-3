'''jacksy'''
#{{slang}} {{British}} [[vagina]]
This is a shortened version of the cockney rhyming slang 'jack and danny', which is rhyming slang for 'fanny'.  'Fanny', in Britain, is one of the many euphemisms for 'vagina'.  'Fanny', in the United States, means 'bottom', as in 'I'd like to pat her on the fanny.'  Bad thing to say in Britain...
