===Etymology===
Related to creative origin of ''Mr. Zilch'' in ''Ballyhoo'', 1930's humor magazine.

If the word "zilch" originated in the 1930's from the character zilch of the Ballyhoo magazine, then why did it not appear in commom usage until the 1960's? Because "zilch" did not mean nothing. It was a fictional family name with at least three members. Fictional families names are usually only used to compare and help describe another family with similar traits.

If the word "zilch" meaning nothing originated from 'Sielsch' in the 1960's, then why was it accepted into common usage? 
A. Because it definitely meant only one thing: nothing!
B. Because it was conceived, somewhat in jest, and generally spoken with humorous flavor, traits which were retained in its accepted common usage.
C. "zilch" turned out to fill a void for a less sensitive, lighter, gentler, and often comical version of nothing.
D. Phonetically it is pleasing to speak, almost forcing a smile or smirk when spoken.

It seems to me that when people working with the origin of words found the word "zilch" showing up in all media during the 1960's, naturally they looked for an origin. The only use of the word "zilch" was in Ballyhoo, used as I explained earlier. So these people had no choice but to say the origin was from Ballyhoo, which they did. They, of course, were not familiar with the 'Sielsch' connection. I have in my possession six different editions of the Ballyhoo Magazine. Nowhere in any of them is there an inference that "zilch" means nothing. The only relationship between "zilch" and nothing was that Elmer Zilch was portrayed as an idler, lazy, and good-for-nothing fellow. See article by OELOELOEL related to ZILCH!
