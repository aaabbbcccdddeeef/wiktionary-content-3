====Usage notes====
*<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">{{sense|although}} The use of ''however'' as a conjunction meaning "[[although]]" is identical to its use as a clause-initial adverb meaning "[[nevertheless]]", except in punctuation (when written) and in prosody (when spoken). Hence, the following unnacceptable sentence:</p><blockquote style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0"><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">(unnacceptable) ''He told me not to do it, '''however''' I did it.''</p></blockquote><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">is equivalent to the following accepted one:</p><blockquote style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0"><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">(accepted) ''He told me not to do it; '''however''', I did it.''</p></blockquote><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">In particular, when used as a conjunction in this sense, ''however'' always appears between the clauses it connects; it does not introduce a true subordinate clause that can be moved to the start of an independent clause, because a conjunctive adverb cannot do that.</p>
