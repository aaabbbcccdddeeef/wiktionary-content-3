===Etymology===
Borrowed from {{bor|de|en|happy}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/ˈhɛpi/}}
* {{audio|de|De-happy.ogg|Audio}}

===Adjective===
{{de-adj|happyer|happysten}}

# {{lb|de|colloquial|chiefly|predicative}} [[glad]]; [[satisfied]]; momentarily {{l|en|happy}}

====Usage notes====
* The German word is used as a synonym of {{m|de|froh||glad, momentarily happy}} rather than {{m|de|glücklich||happy, both momentarily and generally in life}}.
* On the rare occasion that this adjective is used attributively, the positive form ''happy'' typically remains undeclined, whereas the comparation forms are declined in the normal fashion.
