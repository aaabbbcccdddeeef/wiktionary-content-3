===Etymology===
After the specialized glossary [[w:Hobson-Jobson|''Hobson-Jobson'']] which took its name from an [[eye dialect]] rendering by British soldiers in India of the lament {{term|يا حسن يا حسين|sc=Arab|tr=yā ħassan! yā ħussayn!||O Hassan! O Hussein!}} uttered by [[Shia muslims]] crowds during the processions of their main religious event, the  [[mourning of Muharran]]. Actually, the expression has taken the meaning of : "feast, festival".

# A [[word]] or [[phrase]] [[borrow]]ed by one [[language]] from another and [[modify|modified]] in [[pronunciation]] to fit the [[set]] of [[sound]]s the borrowing language typically uses.
#* '''1977''', Robert H. Stacy, ''Defamiliarization in Language and Literature, page 51
#*: If the French for pun, ''calembour'', derives (as Spitzer maintained) from "conundrum"; this points up well the at first puzzling effect of such devices.  ''Caran d'Ache'' is in fact an intentional '''hobson-jobson'''.
#* '''2003''', Jan Venolia, ''The Right Word!''‎, page 4
#*: A '''Hobson-Jobson''' turns a difficult word or phrase into something more tractable (or perhaps less offensive).  By that route, a Texas river that French trappers had named Purgatoire became the Picketwire, and the Malay word ''kampong'' became the English word ''compound''.
