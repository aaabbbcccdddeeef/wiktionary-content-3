# ''(rare)'' [[divination|Divination]] by interpreting rainwater. [[Omen]]s are drawn from the various formations and sizes of rain puddles, and bowls of rainwater are gazed upon until [[clairvoyant]] visions appear on the surface of the water, or in the mind's eye. This is considered in some cases to be more important than [[hydromancy]] because rain has fallen from the [[heaven]]s, making it [[sacred]].
