This was a common word in Newfoundland for a person who was "unmotivated" (lazy). While the rest of the men were off fishing, the "hangashore" was doing everything he could to avoid work, and had no interest in going out to sea. Thus he would "hang ashore" while the rest of the men were busy fishing.
