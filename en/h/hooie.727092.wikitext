The word Hooie may be an ancient [[Jewish]] word which inferred that a person was lying.

In the Southern United States it was an expression of relief. After completing a hard physical job the worker may stand up and exclaim; "Hooie!" holding out, or emphasising the oh sound. However in the Southern United States it may also have been used to infer that a person was lying. "You're full of hooie" meant that you were telling a lie.
