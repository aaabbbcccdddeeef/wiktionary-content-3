===Pronunciation===

===Etymology===
Extension of [[sesquippedalophobia|sesqui(p)pedalophobia]] with [[monstrum]] "monster" and a truncated form of [[hippopotamus]], intended to exaggerate the length of the word itself and the idea of the size of the words being feared. The word consists of 36 letters.

===Noun===
{{en-noun|-}}

# The fear of long words, ironically. It is literally the hippopotamus- and monster-related fear of very long words.

====Usage notes====
*It is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning. The term [[sesquippedalophobia]] is recognized in formal writing, while the four-syllable phrase "fear of long words" is certainly worth considering.
*In the book Useless Knowledge, this enormous word was misinterpreted by the authors as two words, causing them to list the fear of long words as the following:
*:* hippopotomonstroses
*:* quippedaliophobia

===Related terms===
*[[sesquipedalian]]
