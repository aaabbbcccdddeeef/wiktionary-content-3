===Etymology===
Extension of [[sesquippedalophobia|sesqui(p)pedalophobia]] with [[monstrum]] "monster" and a truncated form of [[hippopotamus]], intended to exaggerate the length of the word itself and the idea of the size of the words being feared. The word consists of 36 letters.

===Noun===
{{en-noun|-}}

# The fear of long words, ironically. It is literally the hippopotamus- and monster-related fear of very long words.

====Usage notes====
*It is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning. The term [[sesquippedalophobia]] is recognized in formal writing, while the four-syllable phrase "fear of long words" is certainly worth considering.
*In the book Useless Knowledge, this enormous word was misinterpreted by the authors as two words, causing them to list the fear of long words as the following:
*:* hippopotomonstroses
*:* quippedaliophobia

These fragments appear to be quoted occasionally in other sources.

====Quotations====
*'''2002''' - However, we assume that despite the best endeavours of science, some phobias will always remain. These include [[paraskavedekatriaphobia]], or fear of Friday the 13th. And '''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia''', which is fear of long words.  - anon, ''The Scotsman'' (April 9, 2002) page 13.
*'''2002''' - Those who find this column troubling are suffering from ''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia'' - the fear of long words. Or, more likely, [[rupophobia]] - a fear of rubbish. - Chris Lloyd in ''The Northern Echo'' (December 14, 2002) page 10
