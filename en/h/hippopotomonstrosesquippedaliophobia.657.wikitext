==English==
===Etymology===
Combination of elements suggesting largeness or length, deliberately forming a word likely to induce the fear it denotes: ''hippopotomonstro-'' (irregular blend [influenced by connective ''-o-'', from French, from Latin, from Greekâ€”connective vowel of most nouns and adjectives in combination] of [[hippopotamus]] and ''monstro-'', from Latin ''monstr-'', ''monstrum'', monster) + ''sesquippedalio-'' (incorrectly formed from [[sesquipedalian]] or Latin ''[[sesquipedalia]]'', things one and a half feet long) + [[-phobia]]

The word is Ironic eh? fear of long words
