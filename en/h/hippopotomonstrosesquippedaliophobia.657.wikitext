===Noun===
'''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia''' (''[[uncountable]]'')

#Fear of long words.


====Usage notes====
* Let us call it the fat hippo, shall we?  It is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning. The term sesquipedalophobia is recognized in formal writing, while the four-syllable phrase "fear of long words" is certainly worth considering.
* In the book Useless Knowledge, this enormous word was misinterpreted by the authors as two words, causing them to list the fear of long words as the following:

    hippopotomonstroses
    quippedaliophobia

These fragments appear to be quoted occasionally in other sources. Thus, cogito ergo sum
