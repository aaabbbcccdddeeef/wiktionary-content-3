==Catalan==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|la|ca}} [[ibi]], there.

Despite the many similarities between the modern Catalan '''hi''' and the modern French ''[[y#French|y]]'', it is a matter of debate at what stage the distinction between the two forms occurred. In both the ''[[w:langue d'oc|langue d'oc]]'' and in Proto-Iberian dialects of [[w:vulgar Latin|vulgar Latin]] (the two most probable sources of the pronoun in medieval Catalan), ''ibi'' became contracted first to ''vi'' and then to ''hi'': the transformation in the ''[[w:langue d'oïl|langue d'oïl]]'', and [[thence]] to Middle French, is less clear.
