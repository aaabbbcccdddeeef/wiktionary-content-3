==Catalan==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|la|ca}} [[ibi]], there.

Despite the many similarities between the modern Catalan '''hi''' and the modern French ''[[y#French|y]]'', it is a matter of debate at what stage the distinction between the two forms occurred. In both the ''[[w:langue d'oc|langue d'oc]]'' and in Proto-Iberian dialects of [[w:vulgar Latin|vulgar Latin]] (the two most probable sources of the pronoun in medieval Catalan), ''ibi'' became contracted first to ''vi'' and then to ''hi'': the transformation in the ''[[w:langue d'oïl|langue d'oïl]]'', and [[thence]] to Middle French, is less clear.

===Pronoun===
{{ca-pron|type=unstressed personal|encl=-hi}}

# ''represents a place associated with the action described by the verb, unless the place would be introduced by the preposition [[de#Catalan|de]]''
# [[there]] (in constructions such as "[[there is]]", "[[there are]]", etc.: ''see'' [[haver-hi]])
# ''replaces an adverb (or adverbial phrase) describing the manner, instrument or association of an action''
# ''replaces a phrase introduced by any preposition except [[de#Catalan|de]] (most commonly [[a#Catalan|a]] or [[en#Catalan|en]])''
# ''replaces an indefinite noun or an adjective which is the predicate of a verb ''other'' than [[ésser]], [[esdevenir]], [[estar#Catalan|estar]] or [[semblar#Catalan|semblar]]''
# (''Central Catalan'') ''in combination with other object pronouns, the third person singular indirect object pronoun'' ("to him", "to her", "to it")

====Usage notes====
# When more than one object pronoun is associated with a given verb, '''hi''' is alway the last in the group.
# '''Hi''' and [[ho#Catalan|ho]] cannot be used together with the same verb, nor can two '''hi'''s be used together.
# It is sometimes stated that '''hi''' is ''never'' used to replace a compliment beginning with [[de#Catalan|de]]. This is not completely accurate, as '''hi''' can replace ''adverbial'' phrases such as [[de pressa]], [[de sobte]], etc.
