# A [[loud]], [[boisterous]] [[laugh#Noun|laugh]].
#* {{RQ:Shaw Three Plays|chapter=Three Plays for Puritans|page=xxix|passage=Let realism have its demonstration, comedy its criticism, or even bawdry its '''horselaugh''' at the expense of sexual infatuation, if it must; but to ask us to subject our souls to its ruinous glamour, to worship it, deify it, and imply that it alone makes our life worth living, is nothing but folly gone mad eroticallyâ€”a thing compared to which {{w|Falstaff}}'s unbeglamored drinking and drabbing is respectable and rightminded.}}
