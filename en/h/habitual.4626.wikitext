===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*gʰeh₁bʰ-}}
The adjective is derived from Late {{inh|en|enm|habitual|t=of one's inherent disposition}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=habituāl|pos=adj|id=MED19745}}</ref> from {{der|en|ML.|habituālis|t=customary; habitual}}, from {{der|en|la|habitus|t=character; disposition; habit; physical or emotional condition; attire, dress}} + {{m|la|-ālis|pos=''suffix forming {{glossary|adjective}}s of relationship''}};<ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=adj.'' and ''n|id=82996|date=1898|nodot=yes}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=adj}}</ref> analysable as {{suffix|en|habit|ual}}. ''Habitus'' is derived from {{m|la|habeō|t=to have; to hold; to own; to possess}} (possibly ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*gʰeh₁bʰ-|t=to grab, take}}) + {{m|la|-tus|pos=''suffix forming action {{glossary|noun}}s from {{glossary|verb}}s''}}.

The noun is derived from the adjective.

It is found in emigrant letters from the early nineteenth century. [...] O'Hara's uses as an inflected first person singular as an iterative '''habitual''', e.g. ''I hopes the'' [&nbsp;] ''family are well&nbsp;…, I hopes you will except [sic!] my thanks for the same&nbsp;…'' (Kean O'Hara, 1818–19). This usage is still to be found in east coast varieties of Irish English.}}
