===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*ḱerd-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|herte}}, from {{inh|en|ang|heorte||heart}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*hertā}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*hertô||heart}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*ḱḗr|t=heart}}. {{dbt|en|cardia}}.

Most of the modern figurative senses (such as passion or compassion, spirit, inmost feelings, especially love, affection, and courage) were present in Old English. However, the meaning “center” dates from the early 14th century.<ref name="etymonline">{{R:Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

The verb sense “to love” is from the 1977 {{w|I Love New York|I ❤ NY}} advertising campaign.<ref name="etymonline"/>
