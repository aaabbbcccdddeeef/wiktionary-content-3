===Etymology===
Ultimately from {{der|de|gmw-pro|*Hildigardu}}, from {{compound|gem-pro|*hildiz|t1=battle|*gardaz|t2=enclosure}}, with the approximate meaning “battle protector”. The modern form is of West Germanic but not High German origin, as it does not show the characteristic High German shift of ''*d'' to ''t''. Compare {{cog|goh|Hildigard}}, {{m|goh|Hiltigart}}.
