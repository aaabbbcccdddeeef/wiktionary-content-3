===Etymology===
Ultimately from {{der|de|gem-pro|*Hildigardaz}}, from {{m+|gem-pro|*hildiz||battle}} + {{m|gem-pro|*gardaz||enclosure}}, with the approximate meaning "battle protector". The modern form is of West Germanic but not High German origin, as it does not show the characteristic High German shift of ''*d'' to ''t''.
