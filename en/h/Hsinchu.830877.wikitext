#*:The removal of the capital of the island of Formosa from Tainanfu, on the coast, to Taipeh, gave Governor Liu Ming Chuan an excuse to construct a railway between the capital and the coast in spite of the opposition in Peking. In 1889 a twelve-mile line connecting Tuatutia and Saitingka was opened to traffic. The work was continued until 1893, at which time 62 miles were opened to traffic between '''Hsinchu''' and the northern port of Keelung. At this period the Peking government issued an order to suspend further construction work. All the collieries were closed, and, with the exception of passenger traffic there was little activity in transportation.

#*:The removal of the Prefect from Teukcham to Banka was what was required to consolidate the city, and when that occurred in May last, progress set in with vigour. With the Prefect's departure from Teukcham occurred a change in the name and constitution of that place. It ceased to be called Teukcham, receiving in place of this the name of '''Hsinchu''', and being converted from a ''t'ing'' into a ''hsien''. It is now known as '''Hsinchu'''-hsien ({{lang|zh|新竹縣}}).
