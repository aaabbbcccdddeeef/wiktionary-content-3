#*:The removal of the Prefect from Teukcham to Banka was what was required to consolidate the city, and when that occurred in May last, progress set in with vigour. With the Prefect's departure from Teukcham occurred a change in the name and constitution of that place. It ceased to be called Teukcham, receiving in place of this the name of '''Hsinchu''', and being converted from a ''t'ing'' into a ''hsien''. It is now known as '''Hsinchu'''-hsien ({{lang|zh|新竹縣}}).
