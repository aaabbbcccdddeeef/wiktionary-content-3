# [[hydrophilic|Hydrophilic]].
#* '''1926''', ''Ars Medici'':
#*: lt is difficult to produce an absolutely non-irritant vaseline. Lanolin (wool fat) is indeed clear and smooth but it is neither very '''hydrophile''' nor neutral, so that it cannot be mixed with basic substances such as zinc oxide without saponifying.
#* '''1976''', ''Studia biophysica'':
#*: Partial dehydration of MetHb (by forming films at high relative humidities from solutions) produces a haemichrome structure of this molecule. These structural changes are prevented by binding the molecules to a very '''hydrophile''' dialdehyde - Sephadex carrier (DAS).
#* '''1982''', Y.P. Mel'nik, ''Precambrian Banded-Iron-Formations'' ({{ISBN|9780080869049}}), page 130:
#*: They are very '''hydrophile''', and hydration of the particles is a factor sufficient to make the colloidal system stable even in the absence of stabilizing electrolytes, i.e. when the particles have no electrical charge of their own.
#* '''2000''', ''Geological Quarterly'':
#*: [...] reacts  with water to a minimum extent, by contrast with minerals of the smectite group, which are regarded as very '''hydrophile''' due to their labile, “mobile” structure.
