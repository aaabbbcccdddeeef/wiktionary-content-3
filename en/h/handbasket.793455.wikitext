|passage=I have always wondered how the world, which is very large, can fit into something as small as a '''handbasket'''. To deepen my confusion, I’m not even sure I know what a '''handbasket''' is. Aren’t all baskets in fact '''handbaskets''', and if they are, isn’t the prefix ''hand'' wholly unnecessary? We should probably say: “The world is going to hell in a basket,” although that sounds even worse, doesn’t it?}}
