===Etymology===
From {{affix|en|humble|bee}}, where {{m|en|humble}} is from {{der|en|fro|(h)[[umble]]}}, from {{der|en|la|humilis||low, slight, hence mean, humble}} (compare {{cog|grc|χαμαλός||on the ground, low, trifling}}), from {{m|la|humus||the earth, ground}}, {{m|la|humī||on the ground}}; thus a humblebee is a “ground bee” or a “bee of the earth”, based on many species nesting in underground burrows.
