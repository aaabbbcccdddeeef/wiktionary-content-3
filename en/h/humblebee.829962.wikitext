===Etymology===
From [[humble]] + [[bee]], where [[humble]] is from Old French (h)umble, from Latin humilis (“low, slight, hence mean, humble”) (compare Greek χαμαλός (khamalós, “on the ground, low, trifling”)), from humus (“the earth, ground”), humi (“on the ground”), thus a "humblebee" is a "ground bee" or a "bee of the earth," based on many species nesting in underground burrows.
