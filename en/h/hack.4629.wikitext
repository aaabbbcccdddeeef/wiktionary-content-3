==English==

===Pronunciation===

* {{rhymes|en|æk}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|hacken}}, {{m|enm|hakken}}, from {{inh|en|ang|*haccian|gloss=to hack}}; attested in {{m|ang|tōhaccian||to hack to pieces}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*hakkōną||to chop; hoe; hew}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*keg-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*keng-||to be sharp; peg; hook; handle}}.

Cognate with {{cog|stq|häkje||to hack}}, {{cog|fy|hakje||to hack}}, {{cog|nl|hakken||to chop up; hack}}, {{cog|de|hacken||to chop; hack; hoe}}, {{cog|da|hakke||to chop}}, {{cog|sv|hacka||to hack; chop}}, {{cog|fr|hacher||to chop}}.

The computer senses date back to at least 1955 when it initially referred to creative problem solving. By 1963, the negative connotations of “{{m|en|black hat}}” or malicious hacking had become associated with telephone hacking (cf. {{m|en|phreaking}}).<ref name="ny">{{cite-journal|journal={{w|New Yorker}} |title=A Short History of “Hack” |last=Yagoda |first=Ben |date=March 6, 2014|url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-short-history-of-hack}}</ref>
