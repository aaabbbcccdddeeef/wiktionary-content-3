==English==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/hæk/|lang=en}}
* {{rhymes|æk|lang=en}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|hacken}}, {{m|enm|hakken}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|*haccian}} {{gloss|"to hack"; attested in {{m|ang|tōhaccian||to hack to pieces}}}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*hakkōną||to chop; hoe; hew}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*keg-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*keng-||to be sharp; peg; hook; handle}}.

Cognate with Saterland Frisian {{m|stq|häkje||to hack}}, West Frisian {{m|fy|hakje||to hack}}, Dutch {{m|nl|hakken||to chop up; hack}}, German {{m|de|hacken||to chop; hack; hoe}}, Danish {{m|da|hakke||to chop}}, Swedish {{m|sv|hacka||to hack; chop}}.

The computer senses date back to at least 1955 when it initially referred to creative problem solving. By 1963, the negative connotations of “{{l|en|black hat}}” or malicious hacking had become associated with telephone hacking (cf. {{l|en|phreaking}}).<ref name="ny">{{cite-journal|journal={{w|New Yorker}} |title=A Short History of “Hack” |last=Yagoda |first=Ben |date=March 6, 2014}}</ref>
