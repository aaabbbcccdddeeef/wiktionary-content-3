====Usage notes====
'''Interrogative auxiliary verb'''

'''have ...?''' (''[[third-person]] [[singular]]'' '''has ...?''', ''third-person singular negative'' '''hasn't ...?''' ''or'' '''has ... not?''', ''negative for all other persons, singular and plural'' '''haven't ...?''' ''or'' '''have ... not?'''); ''in each case, the [[ellipsis]] stands for a pronoun''

# Used with a following [[pronoun]] to form [[tag question]]s after statements that use "have" to form the [[perfect tense]] or (in UK usage) that use "have" in the present tense.
#:<tt>“</tt>We haven't eaten dinner yet, '''have we'''?<tt>”</tt>
#:<tt>“</tt>Your wife hasn't been reading that nonsense, '''has she'''?<tt>”</tt>
#:<tt>“</tt>I'd bet that student hasn't studied yet, '''have they'''?<tt>”</tt>
#:<tt>“</tt>You've known all along, '''haven't you'''?<tt>”</tt>
#:<tt>“</tt>The sun has already set, '''has it not'''?<tt>”</tt>
#:(''UK usage'') <tt>“</tt>He has some money, '''hasn't he'''?<tt>”</tt> (''see usage notes below'')
*This construction forms a tag that converts a present perfect tense sentence into a question. The tag always uses an object pronoun substituting for the subject. Negative sentences use ''has'' or ''have'', distinguished by number. Affirmative sentences use the same followed by ''not'', or alternatively, more commonly, and less formally, ''hasn't'' or ''haven't''.
*In American usage, this construction does not apply to present tense sentences with ''has'' or ''have'', or their negations, as a verb; it does not apply either to the construction "have got". In those cases, use "[[does]]" or its negation instead.  For example: "He has some money, doesn't he?" and "I have got enough time, don't I?"  These constructions with "do", "does", "don't" or "doesn't" are considered incorrect in UK usage.
