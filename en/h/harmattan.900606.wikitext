* Alexander Knox, in ''The Climate of the Continent of Africa'',<!--quoted by Emory Ross, ''The Climate of Liberia and its effect on man'', in the 1919 ''Geographical Review''--> explains that "the Harmattan [...] is a hot wind in some localities and a cold wind in others, according to circumstances." This is why some sources, both old and modern, call it a hot wind, while others call it a cold one.<!--see talk page for such references-->
