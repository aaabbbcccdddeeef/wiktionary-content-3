===Alternative forms===
* [[heav'n]] {{qual|dated}}

===Etymology===
From a wide variety of {{inh|en|enm|-}} forms including {{m|enm|heven}}, {{m|enm|hevin}}, {{m|enm|heuen}}{{,}} and {{m|enm|hewin||heaven, sky}}, from {{inh|en|ang|heofon||heaven, sky}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*hebun|*hebn|t=heaven, sky}}, of uncertain origin.<ref name="oed"/>

Cognate with {{cog|sco|heiven}}, {{m|sco|hewin||heaven, sky}}, {{cog|osx|heƀan||heaven, sky}}, {{cog|nds|Heven|t=heaven, sky}}, {{cog|gmh|heben|t=sky, heaven}}, and possibly the rare {{cog|is|-}} and {{cog|non|hifinn||heaven, sky}}, which are probably [[dissimilation|dissimilated]] forms of the Germanic root which appears in {{cog|non|himinn||heaven, sky}}, {{cog|got|𐌷𐌹𐌼𐌹𐌽𐍃||heaven, sky}}, {{cog|gmq-osw|himin}}, {{cog|gmq-oda|himæn}} and probably also (in another variant form) {{cog|osx|himil}}, {{cog|odt|himil}} (modern {{cog|nl|hemel}}){{,}} and {{cog|goh|himil}} ({{cog|de|Himmel}}).<ref name=oed/>

Accepting these as cognates, some scholars propose a further derivation from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*himinaz|t=cover, cloud cover, firmament, sky, heaven}}.<ref name="GH">Gerhard Köbler, ''Altenglisches Wörterbuch'', entry "heofon"</ref><ref name=oed/>
