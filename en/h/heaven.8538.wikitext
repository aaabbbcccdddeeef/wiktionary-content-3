==English==
{{wikipedia|dab=heaven (disambiguation)|heaven|lang=en}}

===Alternative forms===
* [[heav'n]]

===Etymology===
From a wide variety of {{inh|en|enm|-}} forms including {{m|enm|heven}}, {{m|enm|hevin}}, {{m|enm|heuen}}{{,}} and {{m|enm|hewin||heaven, sky}}, from {{inh|en|ang|heofon||heaven, sky}}, of uncertain origin.<ref name="oed"/>

Cognate with Scots {{m|sco|hevin}}, {{m|sco|hewin||heaven, sky}}, {{cog|nds|heven|hēven|heaven, sky}}, {{cog|osx|heƀan||heaven, sky}}, and possibly the rare {{etyl|is|-}} and {{cog|non|hifinn||heaven, sky}}, which are probably [[dissimilation|dissimilated]] forms of the Germanic root which appears in {{cog|non|himinn||heaven, sky}}, {{cog|got|𐌷𐌹𐌼𐌹𐌽𐍃||heaven, sky}}, {{cog|gmq-osw|himin}}, {{cog|gmq-oda|himæn}} and probably also (in another variant form) {{cog|osx|himil}}, {{cog|odt|himil}} (modern {{cog|nl|hemel}}){{,}} and {{cog|goh|himil}} ({{cog|de|Himmel}}).<ref name=oed/>

Accepting these as cognates, some scholars propose a further derivation from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*heminaz||cover, heaven, sky}},<ref name="GH">Gerhard Köbler, ''Altenglisches Wörterbuch'', entry "heofon"</ref> from {{der|en|ine-pro|*k(')emen-||sky, heaven}},<ref name="GH"/> from {{cog|ine-pro|*ḱem-||cover, shroud}}.<ref name="GH"/> Such a derivation would make the word cognate with {{m|en|shame}}.<ref name=oed/>
