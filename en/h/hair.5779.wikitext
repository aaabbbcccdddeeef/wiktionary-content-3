===Etymology===
Old English ''[[hēr]]'', ''[[heer]]'', ''[[hær]]'', Anglo Saxon ''[[hǣr]]'' from Common Germanic *''[[haeram]]''.
A cognate of the latter seems to be Lithuanian ''[[šerys]]''.
From the same Germanic word come, indirectly, Old Frisian ''[[hēr]]'', Dutch ''[[haar]]'', German ''[[Haar]]'', Old High German ''[[hār]]'', Icelandic ''[[hár]]'' and Swedish ''[[hår]]''.
