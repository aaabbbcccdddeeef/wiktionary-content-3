===Etymology===
From [[Proto-Indo-European]] *tkei-. The originally palatal 'k' became a gutteral in the centum languages, including the Germanic languages. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, from the o-grade *tkoi- (o instead of e) came Common Germanic *haimaz, from which English "home", German [[Heim]] and the place-name segment "-ham" ("village") (through Middle Dutch and Old French).
