# {{uncountable}} [[deliberate|Deliberate]] exaggeration.
# {{countable}} An [[instance]] or [[example]] of this technique.

====Usage notes====
* When used as a literary device, hyperbole is an exaggeration that, while not intended to be taken literally, still describes a situation or image that is at least feasible or possible. Exaggeration that is considered impossible is called [[adynaton]].
*: ''Examples:'' "I have been waiting for hours for the end of your 'short' coffee break." is a hyperbole while "I have been waiting for ages for the end of your 'short' coffee break." is an adynaton.
* This distinction is not always observed, even in textbooks.
