===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|handsum}}, {{m|enm|hondsom}}, equivalent to {{suffix|en|hand|some|pos=adjective}}. Compare {{cog|nl|handzaam}}, {{cog|nds-de|handsaam}}. The original sense was ‘easy to handle or use’, hence ‘suitable’ and ‘apt, clever’ (mid 16th century), giving rise to the current appreciatory senses (late 16th century).
