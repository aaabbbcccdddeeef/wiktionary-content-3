'''Hic Rhodus, hic salta''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase translated as "Here is [[Rhodes]], jump here!"  The phrase arises in [[Aesop's Fables]] (Gibbs 209; Perry 33: Chambry 51) in the story of a boastful [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]] who bragged that he had once achieved a stupendous [[long jump]] at an athletic competition on the island of Rhodes, and that he could produce [[witness|witnesses]] to this feat if necessary.  A bystander challenged him to dispense with the reports of the witnesses and simply repeat his accomplishment on the spot: "Here is Rhodes, jump here!"

Since Aesop's Fables were written in [[Ancient Greek]], the Latin form of the phrase is itself a translation, although a conventional one.  The phrase is also given as '''Hic Rhodus, hic saltus''' ("Here is Rhodes, here is [your] jump"); since the Latin verb ''saltare'' properly means "[[dance]]", the version with "saltus" is more faithful to the sense of the fable.  The common corruption of "saltus" to "salta" may be due to [[Hegel]] and later to [[Marx]].
