===Etymology===
The phrase arises from the {{etyl|la|en}} form of ''[[w:Aesop's Fables|Aesop's Fables]]'' (Gibbs 209; Perry 33: Chambry 51), as translated from [[Ancient Greek]] "Αὐτοῦ γὰρ καὶ Ῥόδος καὶ πήδημα" {{literally}} "Here is [[Rhodes]], jump here!". In the fable, a boastful athlete brags that he once achieved a stupendous long jump in competition on the island of Rhodes. A bystander challenges him to dispense with the reports of the witnesses and simply repeat his accomplishment on the spot: "Here is Rhodes, jump here!"
