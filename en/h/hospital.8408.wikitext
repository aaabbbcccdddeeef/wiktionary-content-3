===Will You DIE In The Hospital?   Keep this with you.===
Things you must know first:
Understand this first: Despite the “superhuman” efforts of the hospital staff, its physicians and nurses, a hospital is a hazardous place for its employees, its visitors and is especially risky to patients which are most vulnerable.  Hospitals are full of dangerous equipment and are warehouses for germs, bacteria, viruses and infectious diseases. You will be placing your health in the hands of people you don’t know, some of them making minimum wage.  Any feeling of being “safe” in a hospital is a misconception.  

When you are hospitalized, you may feel you have lost many of your rights and dignities. Unless you complain and demand your rights you will eat what and when you are told, you will be awakened at all hours, you will be subjected to intrusive and often painful medical tests, you will be partially or totally undressed on a regular basis by people who you do not know.  Remember that you have the legal right to refuse any treatment or procedure, and you must leave the hospital if you feel you are not being treated properly.  Doctors, nurses, hospitals or their security staff cannot force treatments or procedures on you nor can they kidnap or incarcerate you. They cannot keep you from leaving. You can bring charges of kidnapping or false imprisonment, file a suit, and win damages in court if they do.  You also have the right to examine the hospital’s charge master and determine the charge for any service or procedure before it is administered.
 
You can be charged over $600.00 per minute for treatments and procedures.  Hospitals can control you and your finances by controlling your pain.  Basically it’s “your money or your life”.  Realize that hospitals make a large percentage of their profits from people that behave recklessly, use tobacco, drink alcohol, take drugs, expose themselves to the elements and have eating disorders.  Consider being more careful or changing your habits to avoid a hospital stay. Each day that you stay immobile in the hospital environment increases your risk of death because of the inherent hazards.

An average of almost 200,000 people die each year in the United States due to potentially preventable, in-hospital medical errors. Don’t be fooled by “the hospital is so clean”, “everyone is so nice”, “they are so helpful” or other first impressions.  Some hospital have had to close for complete disinfection because they were so dirty. The staff is well trained to make certain you have these first favorable impressions.  Make certain that all equipment is new and not reprocessed or cleaned.  Many hospitals clean and reuse Single Use Devices (SUD’s) and charge you for new items.  Insist on all new equipment. Make sure you get all packaging materials from any devices and coordinate them with your medical record.  You risk infection if you are treated with “reprocessed SUD’s”.  

==What you need to take to the hospital to help you get what you need from the medical system:==
There are obvious items to take to the hospital; insurance cards, spare underwear, etc.  The items listed below are not obvious but they may SAVE YOUR LIFE, aid you with malpractice lawsuits if necessary and provide evidence to reduce your hospital bill.  They will also avoid your being held hostage by those in the medical field.  Remember, hospitals regulate themselves and make their own rules, there is absolutely no law that requires them to reveal mistakes they make.

==Make certain you have these with you:==
'''1)''' An assistant/advocate. Someone to help you with basic needs and ensure the hospital staff is responsive to your requirements. This assistant should write notes and operate cameras and recording equipment.  This person must be with you at all times or know exactly where you are and what is happening to you. A valuable asset for dealing with today's hospital may be a member of your family -- preferably one who is knowledgeable, considerate, spunky and can act as a guard, provide surveillance, become and a rescue worker if need be.  Remember that doctors, nurses, and hospital staff are not patient advocates.  Most hospitals have "special patient advocates" which usually turn out to be "hospital advocates in disguise".   These advocates are quite willing to discuss parking, how important a good breakfast is, the current sale in the hospital gift shop, the weather, television adjustments, and how hot your food is but will do little else. You will need an outsider to lobby for your interests and watch for irregularities and mistakes.
You will need a MEDICAL ADVISOR to help you with decisions. This person should be consulted for major decisions and review life threatening procedures before you "sign your life away". This is the person that can save your life.  Always consider getting a second and even third opinion.  Understand that adding yet another person to the mix may complicate your communication with nurses and doctors but it could also save your life.  This person will eventually review and research your medical record for correctness.

'''2)''' A medical dictionary for quick reference.   Don’t be intimidated! Learn to ask what unfamiliar words mean.

'''3)''' Two digital still cameras with adequate batteries and memory for at least 5000 pictures.

'''4)''' Two video cameras with adequate batteries and memory for your hospital duration.

'''5)''' Two digital audio recorders with adequate memory and batteries for recording all conversations and commentsalong with 2 notebooks, plenty of paper, pens and pencils for written notes. 

'''6)''' Two cellular telephones, extra batteries and chargers.  Stay in contact with your assistant.

'''7)''' A portable computing device with internet access for web research, preferably not on the hospitals WI-FI.

'''8)''' Your own equipment for blood pressure readings and a clock with a second hand.  Know how to use it; have your assistant help.

==Things you must continuously do:==
'''1)'''  Make sure you are NEVER ALONE.  You must never be alone. Someone you trust must always be with you.  If the hospital will not allow this something is wrong.  Leave.

'''2)'''  Understand what the physician’s plan is ---- make sure he sticks to it or explains why changes are made.

'''3)'''  Make sure any staff that touches you has washed their hands and you see them do it.  Protective gloves must be put on with clean hands otherwise they only protect the staff member, not you.

'''4)'''  If your contacts are brief, ask why. Why doesn't the hospital staff spend more time with you? Check your medical record for times recorded.  Did the doctor really spend 45 minutes with you?

'''5)'''  Record all times, names and titles of people that you have contact with.  Demand a copy of your medical record when you leave.  Computerized records are now available as fast as the printer runs.

Take your own blood pressure and respiration rate readings every hour and record them - these are the first sign of problems - don't rely on the hospital staff to make timely and accurate readings.

'''6)'''  Ask what the doctor expects, or doesn’t expect, to learn from medical tests.  Inquire about all possible treatment options.

'''7)'''  Double check any medications you are given, record the times and amounts and the staff administering.

'''8)'''  Avoid contact as much as possible.  If you can smell someone’s perfume, aftershave or body odor you are inhaling the bacteria, germs and viruses they carry on and within their body.

'''9)'''  Question the length of your hospital stay, get it reduced.

'''10)'''  Make sure your diet is correct – many people have died in hospitals due to malnutrition.

'''11)'''  Don’t be fooled by the staff’s bedside manner covering up the lack of actual skills.

'''12)'''  Record, document and question everything. If you don’t, it will be your money AND your life.
