hayfield: simply a field of hay; when the hay is cut the field is more like a meadow, especially if green grass or weeds grow in the field after hay harvesting.   One might then call the field a meadow.  One could then run across the hayfield or meadow if you will, feeling so young as Frank Sinatra and someone ln the song "You make me feel so young".  "Like a couple of tots running across a meadow".
