#* '''1653''', {{w|Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish}}, ''Poems and Fancies'', London: J. Martin & J. Allestrye, “To the Reader,”<sup>[http://name.umdl.umich.edu/A53061.0001.001]</sup>
#*: {{...}} I have no ''Children'' to imploy my ''Care'', and ''Attendance'' on; And my ''Lords Estate'' being taken away, had nothing for '''''Huswifery''''', or thrifty ''Industry'' to imploy my selfe in; having no ''Stock'' to work on. For '''Housewifery''' is a discreet ''Management'', and ordering all in ''Private'', and ''Household Affaires'', seeing nothing ''spoil’d'', or ''Profusely spent'', that every thing has its proper ''Place'', and every ''Servant'' his proper ''Work'', and every ''Work'' to be done in its proper ''Time''; to be ''Neat'', and ''Cleanly'', to have their ''House'' quiet from all ''disturbing Noise''. But ''Thriftiness'' is something stricter; for good '''Housewifery''' may be used in great ''Expenses''; but ''Thriftiness'' signifies a ''Saving'', or a getting; as to increase their ''Stock'', or ''Estate''.
