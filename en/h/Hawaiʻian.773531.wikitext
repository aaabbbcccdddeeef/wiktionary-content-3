====Usage notes====
* This is a common misconception to spell the word Hawaiian with an ʻokina. Hawaiian is an English word and the ʻokina is a letter used in the Hawaiian language. The proper spelling of Hawaiʻi uses the okina because that is a word that comes from the Hawaiian language (Ōlelo Hawaiʻi). However, Hawaiʻian is  common mistake made as an alternate spelling to the word English-word Hawaiian.
