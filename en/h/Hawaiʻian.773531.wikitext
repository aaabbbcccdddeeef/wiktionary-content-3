# {{alternative spelling of|[[Hawaiian]]}} not in common use, and sometimes disparaged because of the mismatch of pronunciation vis the Engish word "Hawaiian." The ʻokina (glottal stop) is a consonant of the Hawaiian language, and is entirely appropriate for use in Hawaiian words, but can be misused when applied capriciously to English words (such as the word Hawaiian). The terms for a Hawaiian person in the Hawaiian language include: Hawaiʻi, kanaka Hawaiʻi, and kanaka maoli, but not, Hawaiʻian.
