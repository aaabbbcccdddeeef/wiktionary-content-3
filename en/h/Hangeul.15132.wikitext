* The spelling [[hangeul]] is from the Korean spelling in the 2000 South Korean Revised transcription. “Hangul” derives from the older [[McCune-Reischauer]] transcription “hangŭl” written without the diacritics: it is the more common English spelling. Within the English Wiktionary, “hangeul” is preferred.
