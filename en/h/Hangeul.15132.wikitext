====Usage notes====
*The spelling [[hangeul]] is from the Korean spelling in the 2000 South Korean Revised transcription. “Hangul” is probably from the older [[McCune-Reischauer]] transcription “Han’gŭl” written without the diacritics: it is the more common English spelling. Within the English Wiktionary, “hangeul” is preferred.

===Dictionary notes===
*'''MSN Encarta Dictionary''' lists only the spellings “Hangul” and “hangul”.
*'''Merriam-Webster Online''' lists only the spelling “hangul” and notes that it is often capitalised.
