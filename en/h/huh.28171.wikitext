#: ''Where were you last night?  '''Huh'''?''
# Word used to express [[amusement]] or subtle [[surprise]].
#: '''''Huh!'''  I'm sure I locked it when I left.''
# <!--is this regional?--> (Shortening of the slang "I know, huh." and pronounced "haw") Word used solely as a response, in order to express either complete agreement with or to belittle the issuer of a statement or infrequently a question. The intonation is changed to distinguish between the two meanings. When used in agreement, the intonation is friendly and non-confrontational. When used as a sarcastic or belittling response (usually in response to an obvious or rhetorical statement and used as a kind of insult), the intonation is confrontational, exaggeratedly sarcastic, almost always accompanied by a condescending look, and is very close in meaning and use to the slang "[[duh]]".
#: ''Statement: We should go to an amusement park, it would be fun. Response: '''Huh!'''
#: ''or
#: ''Statement: "Murder is bad" Response: '''Huh!'''
# Informally, used to indicate that one did not hear what was said.
#: '''''Huh'''?  Could you speak up?''
