#<!--is this regional?--> (Shortening of the slang "I know, huh." and pronounced "haw") Word used solely as a response, in order to express either complete agreement with or to belittle the issuer of a statement or infrequently a question. The intonation is changed to distinguish between the two meanings. When used in agreement, the intonation is friendly and non-confrontational. When used as a sarcastic or belittling response (usually in response to an obvious or rhetorical statement and used as a kind of insult), the intonation is confrontational, exageratedly sarcastic, almost always accompanied by a condescending look, and is very close in meaning and use to the slang "[[duh]]".
