# Used to express [[doubt]] or [[disapproval]]
#* '''1913''' Eleanor Porter: ''Pollyanna'': Chapter 8:
#*: "There!" panted Pollyanna, hastily plucking a pink from a vase near by and tucking it into the dark hair where it would give the best effect. "Now I reckon we're ready to be looked at!" And she held out the mirror in triumph.<br>"'''Humph'''!" grunted the sick woman, eyeing her reflection severely. "I like red pinks better than pink ones; but then, it'll fade, anyhow, before night, so what's the difference!"
