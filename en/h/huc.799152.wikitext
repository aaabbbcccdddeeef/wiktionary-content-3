==Latin==

===Etymology===
Probably from the Old Latin locative {{m|la|hoi}} + {{m|la|-ce}}, from {{inh|la|ine-pro|*gʰe}} and Proto-Indo-European {{inh|la|ine-pro|*ḱe||here}}, according to De Vaan (2008). Compare the mostly pre-Classical {{m|la|hōc|t=to this place, for this reason}}, which De Vaan says is from an instrumental case form.

Confer the same alternation between {{m|la|illūc}} and the older {{m|la|illōc}}. See also {{m|la|hinc}}.
