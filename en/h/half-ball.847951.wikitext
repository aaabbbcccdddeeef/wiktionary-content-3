# {{context|sports|billiards|snooker|pool}} Describes a shot where the [[cue ball]] and the object ball make contact at a natural 45ยบ angle. So called because the view from the cue ball is half eclipsing the object ball.
#: ''The shot needs to be slightly thicker than '''half-ball''' to get to the center pocket.''
