{{also|House}}
==English==

===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*(s)kewH-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|hous}}, {{m|enm|hus}}, from {{inh|en|ang|hūs||dwelling, shelter, house}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*hūsą}} (compare {{cog|sco|hoose}}, {{cog|fy|hûs}}, {{cog|nl|huis}}, {{cog|de|Haus}}, {{cog|nds-de|Huus}}, {{cog|da|hus}}, {{cog|fo|hús}}, {{cog|is|hús}}, {{cog|nb|hus}}, {{cog|nn|hus}} and {{cog|sv|hus}}), possibly from {{der|en|ine-pro|*(s)kews-}}, from {{m|ine-pro|*(s)kewH-||to cover, hide}}. Eclipsed non-native {{noncog|enm|meson}}, {{m|enm|measoun|t=house}}, borrowed from {{noncog|fro|maison|t=house}}. More at {{l|en|hose}}.

The uncommon plural form ''housen'' is from {{inh|en|enm|husen}}, {{m|enm|housen}}. (The Old English nominative plural was simply {{m|ang|hūs}}.)
