====Usage notes====
Strictly, the past tense of ''hang'' is ''[[hanged]]'' when meaning "to suspend from the neck until dead" and ''[[hung]]'' for all other meanings. However, this rule is not uniformly understood or observed; ''hung'' is sometimes substituted for ''hanged'' or, more rarely, vice versa. Also see etymology at top of page.
