====Usage Note====

Strictly, the past tense of [[hang]] is [[hanged]] when meaning 'to suspend from the neck until dead' and [[hung]] for all other meanings. However, this rule is not uniformly understood or observed; ''hung'' is sometimes substituted for ''hanged'' or (more rarely) vice versa. Also see etymology at top of page.
