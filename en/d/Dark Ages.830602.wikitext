====Usage notes====
The usage of ''Dark Ages'' to refer to the period from roughly 476-1000 is now mostly proscribed by historians as a [[misnomer]], as the term was created during the [[Enlightenment]] referring to lack of historical records at the time, and technological/scholarly progress did not drop as is commonly thought by laymen. A more correct term in contemporary usage is the [[Early Middle Ages]].
