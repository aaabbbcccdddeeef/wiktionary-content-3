{{also|dark ages}}
==English==

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|en|dark ages}}

===Etymology===
The phrase appears in writing of the English Reformation by Richard Sibbes (1620) and by George Abbot (1624), the archbishop of Canterbury. Both authors use it to refer to the period of papal supremacy before the Reformation. The earliest citation in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is dated 1687. Use is specific to English therefore not likely to be from Latin.

====Usage notes====
The usage of ''Dark Ages'' to refer to the period in European history now mostly proscribed by historians as a [[misnomer]], as the term was created during the [[Enlightenment]] referring to lack of historical records at the time, and technological/scholarly progress did not drop as is commonly thought by laymen. A more correct term in contemporary usage is {{m|en|Early Middle Ages}}.
