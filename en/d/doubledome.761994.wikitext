Noun used as a mildly derogatory term for an intellectual, used similarly as "egghead".  The word conjures the image of two bald-headed men putting their heads together in an effort to solve a problem.  It is a word that can now be considered arcane, as it has largely been replaced by the many other words for intellectuals which are commonly used in the pejorative: [[poindexter]], [[Einstein]], [[brainiac]], or [[Steinmetz]].  However one might predict a resurgence of the term since the American pastime of intellectual bashing is in need of less hackneyed terminology.

While the word doubledome refers strictly to intellectualism, it can be considered a synonym for the term [[nerd]]. The word nerd describes only a weak, non-sporting individual.  However, the depiction of nerds as intelligent weaklings in the semi-popular film series "Revenge of the Nerds" completes the link between scholastics and nerdishness.  Through this association, words synonymous with nerdism become anti-intellectual verbiage and thus might then also include the following: [[geek]], [[twink]], [[wombat]], [[zoomer]].  This association is simply further anti-intellectual derisiveness.

The name Doubledome Builders has been used by a small restoration contractor based in Washington, DC since the late 1990s.
