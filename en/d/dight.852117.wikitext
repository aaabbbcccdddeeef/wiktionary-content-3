===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|dighten}}, {{m|enm|dihten}}, (also {{m|enm|dyten}}, > {{l|en|dite}}), from {{inh|en|ang|dihtan}}, {{m|ang|dihtian||to set in order; dispose; arrange; appoint; direct; compose}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dihtōną||to compose; invent}}, of disputed origin. Possibly from a derivative of {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dīkaną||to arrange; create; perform}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*dʰeyǵ-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*dʰeyǵʰ-||to knead; shape; mold; build}}, influenced by {{cog|la|dictāre}}; or perhaps from {{etyl|la|en}} {{m|la|dictāre||to dictate}} itself. See {{m|en|dictate}}; and also parallel formations in German {{m|de|dichten}}, Dutch {{m|nl|dichten}}, Swedish {{m|sv|dikta}}.
