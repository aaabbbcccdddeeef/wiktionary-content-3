''Duncan'', one of the racing trio of destroyers, and ''Boise'' independently spotted the contacts, and both ''Boise'' and ''Helena'' now reported their sightings to Scott, a few minutes later.  But with ''San Francisco'' still not seeing anything, and Scott confirming that the three '''dislocated''' destroyers were coming up fast past the column to starboard, he convinced himself that the contacts that were being spotted were ''actually'' these three escort ships, and, thus, he discarded the reports.}}
