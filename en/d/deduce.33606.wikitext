====Usage notes====
* Regarding sense 1 (“to reach (a conclusion)”), for example, from the premises “all good people believe in the tooth fairy” and “Jimmy does not believe in the tooth fairy”, we deduce the conclusion “Jimmy is not a good person”. This particular form of deduction is called a [[syllogism]]. Note that in this case we reach a false conclusion by correct deduction from a false premise.
