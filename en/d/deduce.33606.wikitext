===Verb===
{{en-verb|deduces|deducing|deduced|deduced}}

# {{context|intransitive|followed by '''that'''}} To reach a [[conclusion]] by applying rules of [[logic]] to given [[premises]].

====Usage notes====
For example, from the premises "all good people believe in the tooth fairy" and "Mary does not believe in the tooth fairy", we deduce the conclusion "Mary is not a good person". This particular form of deduction is called a [[syllogism]].
Note that in this case we reach a false conclusion by correct deduction from false premises.
