====Usage notes====
For example, from the premises "all good people believe in the tooth fairy" and "Mary does not believe in the tooth fairy", we deduce the conclusion "Mary is not a good person". This particular form of deduction is called a [[syllogism]]. Note that in this case we reach a false conclusion by correct deduction from a false premise.
