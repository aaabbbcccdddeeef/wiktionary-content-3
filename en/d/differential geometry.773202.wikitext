# {{lb|en|geometry|analysis}} The study of [[geometry]], especially geometric structures on [[differentiable manifold]]s, using techniques from [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]] and [[multilinear algebra]].
#* '''1945''', {{w|Eric Temple Bell}}, ''The Development of Mathematics'', 2nd Edition, 1992 Republication, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_5KAnw3QMC8C&pg=PA358&dq=%22differential+geometries%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVl_2-yJ_PAhUCRD4KHXNtDPQQ6AEIuAEwGw#v=onepage&q=%22differential%20geometries%22&f=false page 358],
#*: {{...}}projective '''differential geometries''' of the American and Italian schools do not seem to have attracted physicists.
#* '''1962''', I. M. James, ''The Mathematical Works of J. H. C. Whitehead'', Volume 1: '''Differential Geometry''', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sn_iBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&dq=%22differential+geometries%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVl_2-yJ_PAhUCRD4KHXNtDPQQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=%22differential%20geometries%22&f=false page 189],
#*: The general theory of manifolds of class 2 is a sub-class of '''differential geometries''', which contain the theory of affine connections, curvature and osculating sub-spaces.
#* '''1993''', M. A. Akivis, V. V. Goldberg, ''Projective '''Differential Geometry''' of Submanifolds'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=4rdkDQbTpR0C&pg=PR5&dq=%22differential+geometry%22%7C%22differential+geometries%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdqMjpwp_PAhUMeD4KHVZVAXwQ6AEIuwQwWg#v=onepage&q=%22differential%20geometry%22%7C%22differential%20geometries%22&f=false page v],
#*: Note that projective '''differential geometry''' is a basis for Euclidean and non-Euclidean '''differential geometries''' since metric properties of submanifolds of Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces should only be added to their projective properties.
#* '''2012''', Heinrich W. Guggenheimer, '''''Differential Geometry''''', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kavDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&dq=%22differential+geometry%22%7C%22differential+geometries%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdqMjpwp_PAhUMeD4KHVZVAXwQ6AEIkwEwFA#v=onepage&q=%22differential%20geometry%22%7C%22differential%20geometries%22&f=false page 145],
#*: In this sense, <math>C^{k_0}</math> is the natural hypothesis of differentiability in the particular question of '''differential geometry'''.
