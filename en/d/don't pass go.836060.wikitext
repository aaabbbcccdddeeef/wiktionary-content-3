HELLO EVERYONE I HAVE A STRANGE AND DISTURBING STORY TO TELL BUT IT MUST BE TOLD FOR THE BETTERMENT OF US ALL YOU SEE THE OTHER DAY I WENT TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE HE LIVES IN A FINE STUDIO APARTMENT IN THE REGIONS OF BRISTOL AND I WAS ENTERING INTO HIS BATHROOM IN ORDER TO GO TO THE BATHROOM BUT SUDDENLY HE APPROACHED ME FROM BEHIND AND GRABBED MY HAIR FORCIBLY, SLAMMING MY HEAD INTO THE TOILET AND BREAKING OFF THE END OF MY NOSE. I WAS BLEEDING VIOLENTLY BUT HE WOULD NOT STOP HIS TERRIBLE ASSAULT AND STUFFED MY FACE DOWN THE COMMODE COMPLETELY AND THEN FLUSHED IT CAUSING ME TO BE SUCKED INTO THE SEWER SYSTEM WHERE I MET AN ALLIGATOR. HE INFORMED ME OF HIS NAME BUT IT IS UNSPEAKABLE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND THEN I RAN AWAY THROUGH THE SEWERS UNTIL I TRIPPED AND SMASHED MY NOSE AND BECAUSE OF MY PREVIOUS TENDERNESS OF THE NOSE RESULTING FROM MY FRIEND'S ATTACK I FELT SUCH AGONIZING PAIN AS TO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS. WHEN I WOKE A LARGE MAN WAS KNEELING OVER ME HE RESEMBLED AN AVIAN CREATURE AND WAS COVERED IN FEATHERS AND HAD A MASSIVE BEAK AND I GREETED HIM AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HIS PLANET WAS IN TERRIBLE DANGER AND THEN HE GRASPED MY LEG AND LIFTED ME INTO THE SKY BY MY LEG APPARENTLY INTENDING TO BRING ME TO HIS PLANET BY FLYING THROUGH SPACE SOMEHOW BUT HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WAS CARRYING ME WAS SEVERELY DELETERIOUS IN THAT IT CAUSED ALL OF THE BLOOD TO RUSH TO MY HEAD. EVENTUALLY THIS RUSHING OF THE BLOOD IN COMBINATION WITH THE EXTREME SPEED OF THE FLIGHT CAUSED SUCH PRESSURE AS TO BURST MY HEAD AND THE TERRIBLE FRAGMENTS FELL DOWN THE CHIMNEY OF A MAN'S HOUSE AND BOUNCED ONTO HIS KEYBOARD AND MOUSE CAUSING THIS TEXT TO BE ENTERED INTO WIKTIONARY. HAVE A GOOD DAY
