===Etymology 2===
{{wikipedia|Dyke (slang)}}
Uncertain. Attested since the 1940s (in Berrey and Van den Bark’s 1942 ''American Thesaurus of Slang'')<ref>"dike, dyke, n.3" ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989, OED Online, Oxford UP, April 4, 2000.[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50064031].</ref> or 1930s.<ref>{{R:MWO}}</ref>

Semantic development from {{m|en|dyke||ditch}} has been proposed, and some sources from the 1890s are said to record ''dyke'' as slang for "vulva" and ''hedge of the dyke'' as slang for "pubic hair",<ref name="Etymonline"/><ref>[https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/djbkqki Green's Dictionary of Slang, "hedge"]</ref> but ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'' says ''dyke'' in the latter phrase had no reference to lesbianism and Dictionary.com considers a connection unlikely.<ref name="Dictionarycom"/>

{{m|en|bull dyke|Bull dyke}} / {{m|en|bulldike}} is attested earlier, in reference to women since at least the 1920s<ref name="Dictionarycom">{{R:Dictionary.com|bulldyke}}</ref><ref name="Etymonline">{{R:Etymonline}}</ref> (the 29 July 1892 ''Decatur Daily Review'' in [[Illinois]] mentions a woman who "won the affections of Harvey Neal, alias 'Bulldyke'", whose gender is unclear),<ref>[https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/x3tzlsa Green's Dictionary of Slang, "bull-dyke"]</ref><ref>{{cite-web |title=Word Origins: dyke |url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/more/273/ |accessdate=3 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203192616/http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/more/273/ |archivedate=3 December 2019 }}</ref> and {{m|en|bulldyker}} (and the practice of {{m|en|bulldyking}}) are also attested earlier, e.g. in Parke's 1906 ''Human Sexuality'', in the speech of Philadelphians,<ref>Joseph Richardson Parke, ''Human Sexuality: A Medico-literary Treatise'' (1906), page 309: "In American homosexual argot, female inverts, or lesbian lovers, are known euphemistically as 'bulldykers,' whatever that may mean: at least that is their sobriquet in the 'Red Light' district of Philadelphia.</ref> and backcountry American blacks.<ref name="Etymonline"/> Compare {{m|en|bulldagger}}, attested since around the same time<ref name="Dictionarycom"/> and used especially by black women.<ref>JoAnne Myers, ''Historical Dictionary of the Lesbian and Gay Liberation Movements'' (2013), p. 97</ref><ref name="Howard">Yetta Howard, ''Ugly Differences: Queer Female Sexuality in the Underground'' (2018), p. 238, which also refers to "Bogus, “The 'Queen B,'” and Walker, “The Debutante in Harlem,” 58–102, and “Lesbian Pulp in Black and White,” 103–138, for considerations of the figure of the black bulldagger in other Harlem Renaissance texts."</ref>

Other linguists suggested that ''bull dyke(r)'' referred to strong black women who dug dikes, or derived from {{m|en|bull}} + {{m|en|dick}}, perhaps in reference to black men.<ref name="Etymonline"/><ref name="Panati">Charles Panati, ''Sexy Origins and Intimate Things'' (1998), p. 181: "In fact, “bulldiking” is one of the earliest phrases in which the term “dike" has tough female overtones. It appeared in the American South in the nineteenth century, used by American blacks. Some linguists believe that strong black women who Some linguists believe that strong black women who helped dig watercourses on Southern plantations were called “bulldikes.” Others, however, claim that "dike" is really a corruption of "dick", slang for "penis," and [...] argue that in the American South, black men who worked on plantations were called "bull dicks" by their white owners."</ref><!-- Compare {{m|en|dike||well-dressed man}}.--> The suggestion that it is from ''[[morphodyke]]'' (from ''[[morphodite]]'', from ''[[hermaphrodite]]'') is most likely however'.<ref name="Etymonline"/><ref name="Dictionarycom"/>
