#: '''1977''', ''In Cubbaroo's dim distant past <br> They built a double dyke. <br> Back to back in the yard it stood <br> An architectural dream in wood'' <br> &mdash; Ian Slack-Smith, ''The Passing of the Twin Seater'', from ''The Cubbaroo Tales'', 1977.  Quoted in ''Aussie Humour'', Macmillan, 1988, ISBN 0-7251-0553-4, page 235.

====Usage notes====
In the sense of a gay woman, this term is generally derogatory when used by heterosexuals (and sometimes when used by non-heterosexuals), but, it is also used by some lesbians and bisexual women to refer to themselves, positively.  A similar approach to the possibility of reclamation is evident in the use of the word "Queer" among some lesbians, bisexual women, and others.  It is important to note that many people do not believe that "Queer" is able to be reclaimed, because of its fraught history and continued pejorative usage.  Thus, the terms "dyke" and "Queer" are both potentially liberatory while also being highly contested.

====Synonyms====
''* ee also  [[Wikisaurus:lesbian]] a girl that likes a girl''
