What is, what was, and what will always be “Douche?”

Scientists around the world have against their better judgment, come together to practice the study in what is now known as doucheology.  In their beliefs during the evolution of the “Roberts” family tree, the nuclear power reactor that was built only a 100 meters away created a domino effect through the family line blending the D.N.A of the Roberts family to create what scientists now refer to as “dirt bike in the back of the truck syndrome” also scientifically referred to as “Doucheology.”  

        Through the ages the Roberts family has produced many “A Typical Douche.” During the evolution with much inbreeding and chaos the Roberts family has created what scientists from around the world have agreed to accept is the ultimate “Douchebag.” 

        During breeding and forming of type “A normal” the chromosomes form together creating an average human being with the D.N.A. The main role of DNA molecules <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule>  is the long-term storage of information <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information> . DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint>  or a recipe, or a code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code> , since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)> , such as proteins <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein>  and RNA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA>  molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene> , but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. 

        In our research we have found that the D.N.A of a “Roberts” has been skewed. The X & Y chromosomes that we see in normal male and females does not appear in the “Roberts” D.N.A. Instead a new chromosome has taken place that scientists have come to agree in calling this the “D+” chromosome. Thus being the root of the problem that researchers now believe is the genetic failure in the Roberts family tree. 

        In the research of the “D+” syndrome, Russian scientist Igor Jenakowski who was spearheading the research team realized the destructive potential in the “D+” chromosome that was buried inside all of the “Roberts” family members. Hundreds of grueling hours finding the resources, manpower, and information have led him to his suicide. His wife fortunately gave detectives his personal journal that he would write in during his leisure. His last entry dated 06/06/06 was written in code, that was later transcribed by the Harvard Symbology and foreign code team had said “this cancerous disease in society has to be stopped. In my study the human gene pool has come to what I cannot handle. I therefore will take my own life and shoot my god damn head off. It is an embarrassing plight on humankind. Please stop this, and the ginger syndrome.”
