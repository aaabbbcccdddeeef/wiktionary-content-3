===Etymology 1===
Unknown. Possibly (''putative obsolete brand of [[roll-your-own]] tobacco'') + {{m|en|-y||diminutive suffix}}.<br>

David Bradley, Australian Journal of Linguistics (1989) suggests that it may be derived from a widely used brand of loose tobacco used for roll-your-owns, Bull Durham, clipped and resuffixed with the most productive suffix for forming new colloquial words in Australian English.

Suggested that it was a term brought back from ANZAC forces as a Dhurrie Rug and a cigarette are both rolled.
