==English==

===Etymology 1===
Unknown. Possibly (''putative obsolete brand of [[roll-your-own]] tobacco'') + {{m|en|-y||diminutive suffix}}.<br>
From 1940s; evidence of colloquial use from early 20thC.

But also -- Short for '[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Durham_Smoking_Tobacco Bull Durham]', an old (1850s) brand of rolling tobacco, and hence (usually) a roll-your-own cigarette. Used particularly in the Australian Defence Forces.
"David Bradley, Australian Journal of Linguistics (1989) suggests that it may be derived from a widely used brand of loose tobacco used for roll-your-owns, Bull Durham, clipped and resuffixed with the most productive suffix for forming new colloquial words in Australian English." -- Source: Australian National Dictionary Centre, quoted in the [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=durrie Urban Dictionary].
