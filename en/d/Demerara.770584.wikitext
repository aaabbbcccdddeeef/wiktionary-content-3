===Etymology===
[[File:Demerara sugar-1.JPG|right|thumb|Demerara sugar]]
The placename derives from an {{der|en|awd}} word. Perhaps ''Malali'' ("fast running stream"), which would have originally been the name of a section of rapids, from which the Dutch called the whole river ''de Malali'' ("the Malali"), which (with incorporation of the definite article into the name, and alternation of ''l'' and ''r'') became ''Demerara''.<ref>Silvia Kouwenberg, ''A Grammar of Berbice Dutch Creole'' (2011), page 583: Bennett (1985:10) gives the following etymology for Demerara: A few kilometers up the Demerara river is a series of rapids called Malali, which in Arawak means ''fast running stream''. The entire river was given the name Malali. According to [[:w:John P. Bennett|Bennett]], the Dutch custom of writing 'de Malali' resulted in incorporation of the definite article into the noun, later followed by change of l to r."</ref> Alternatively, perhaps ''Immenary'' or ''Dumaruni'' meaning “river of the [[letterwood]]”.<!--{{cn}}--> The sugar is so-called because it was grown in the region around the river.
