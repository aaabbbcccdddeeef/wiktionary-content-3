#*: The stereotypical image of the '''"dusty miller"''', as depicted in popular legend and some traditional literature, is a barrier, and milling is seen by younger people as low-status. There is an urgent need to change this perception through measures such as changing the designation to something like "grain and feed processing technician" and improving training provision and prospects."
# One of several species of plants with leaves of a dusty appearance: {{taxlink|Centaurea cineraria|species}}, {{taxlink|Senecio cineraria|species}}, and {{taxlink|Lychnis coronaria|species}}.
