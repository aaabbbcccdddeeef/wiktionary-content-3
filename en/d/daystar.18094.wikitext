====Usage notes====
The word used in the ''Bible (2 Peter)'' is the Ancient Greek {{l/grc|φωσφόρος}} ‘phosphoros’, the ancient name for the planet Venus. Literally, "light-bringer". It is interpreted by some Christians as allegory for Jesus Christ; see for example [[w:Daystar University|Daystar University]].
