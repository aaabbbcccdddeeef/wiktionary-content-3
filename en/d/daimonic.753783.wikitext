====Quotations====
*Stephen A. Diamond, Ph.D., ''Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic: The Psychological Genesis of Violence, Evil, and Creativity''. Foreword:
*: The '''daimonic''' (unlike the demonic, which is merely destructive) is as much concerned with creativity as with negative reactions. A special characteristic of the '''daimonic''' model is that it considers both creativity on one side, and anger and rage on the other side, as coming from the same source. That is, constructiveness and destructiveness have the same source in human personality. The source is simply human potential.
*'''1969'''. Rollo May, 1969, ''Love and Will'', p. 126-130:
*: The '''daimonic''' needs to be directed and channeled.... Our age is one of transition, in which the normal channels for utilizing the '''daimonic''' are denied; and such ages tend to be times when the '''daimonic''' is expressed in its most destructive form.
