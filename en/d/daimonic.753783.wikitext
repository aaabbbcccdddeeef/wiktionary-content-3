dai·mon·ic also dae·mon·ic (dî-mòn´îk) adjective, noun. As an adjective the word typically means: 

# Befitting a demon; fiendish. 
# Motivated by a spiritual force or genius; inspired. 

But as a noun the word represents a very powerful, and yet mostly misunderstood, literary term:

# The unrest that exists in us all which forces us into the unknown leading to self-destruction and/or self-discovery.
# The journey and transition from innocence to experience.
# The place where light and dark meet.

The journey from innocence to experience is not an idea that originated in the Romantic age, rather the Hero's Journey is a topic older than literature itself, but the term daimonic, which originated with the Greeks, subsequently became the focus of the English Romantic movement in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the diagram below, we see the common threads of the daimonic notion. Typically, the daimonic tale centers around the Solitary, the central character of the story, who usually is introduced in innocence, wealth, and often arrogance, but under the masks of control and order lies a corruption and unconscious desire towards disintegration. Some event, either external or internal, leads the character towards some type of isolation where he is forced to confront his daimons.

The fall or the descent ([[hubris]]) into the world where light and dark meet is usually very dramatic and often torturing for the hero and the audience alike, and comes in a myriad of forms. In the depths, in hitting bottom, he ultimately discovers his own fate and tragedy (catharsis) and in a final climax is either broken or driven towards rebirth and self-knowledge. The glory of the daimonic is in the humble resurrection, though it claims more than it sets free, as many a foolish men are drawn into its vacuum never to return. The hero is unique for "he becomes the daimon's master instead of the daimon's thrall" ([[Stefan Zweig]]). The daimonic has always been, and continues to be, a great source of creativity, inspiration, and fascination in all forms of art.
