# {{substub}} A grease used to inhibit corrosion in electrical connectors whose contacts may be exposed to water or other corrosive material.  (Presumably the specific ingredients in commercially-available dielectric grease are considered proprietary as I have been unable to obtain any specific listings.  More information would be useful in assessing the reliability of connectors using "dielectric" grease.)
