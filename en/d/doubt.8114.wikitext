===Etymology===
{{PIE word|en|dwóh₁}}{{root|en|ine-pro|*gʰeh₁bʰ-}}
The verb is derived from {{inh|en|enm|douten|t=to be in doubt, feel unsure; to be afraid or worried; to hesitate; to be confused; to have respect or reverence}}{{nb...|doubt, doubten, dought, doughten, douti, douʒte, dut, duten, duti|otherforms=1}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=dǒuten|pos=v|id=MED12490}}</ref> from {{der|en|fro|douter}}, {{m|fro|doter}}, {{m|fro|duter}} (compare {{cog|frm|doubter}}), from {{der|en|la|dubitāre|t=to hesitate}}, the {{glossary|present}} {{glossary|active}} {{glossary|infinitive}} of {{m|la|dubitō|t=to be uncertain, doubt; to hesitate, waver in coming to an opinion; to consider, ponder}}; the further etymology is uncertain, but one theory is that ''dubitō'' may be derived from {{m|la|dubius|t=fluctuating, wavering; doubtful, dubious, uncertain}}, from {{m|la|duhibius|t=held as two}}, from {{m|la|duo|t=two}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dwóh₁|t=two}}) + {{m|la|habeō|t=to have, hold}} (possibly ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*gʰeh₁bʰ-|t=to grab, take}}). Although the Middle English form of the word was spelled without a {{m|en|b}}, this letter was later introduced through the influence of the Latin words ''dubitāre'' and ''dubitō''. However, the English word continued to be pronounced without the ''b'' sound.<ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=v|id=57078|date=1897|nodot=yes}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=v}}</ref>

The noun is derived from {{inh|en|enm|dout}}, {{m|enm|doute|t=uncertain feeling; questionable point; hesitation; anxiety, fear; reverence, respect; something to be feared, danger;}}{{nb...|dewt, dote, doubt, doubte, dought, doughte, douthe, douʒte, douȝt, douȝte, dowght, dowt, dowte, dut, dute|otherforms=1}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=dǒut(e|pos=n|id=MED12483}}</ref>
from {{der|en|fro|doute}}, {{m|fro|dote}}, {{m|fro|dute|t=uncertain feeling, doubt}}, from {{m|fro|doter}}, {{m|fro|douter}}, {{m|fro|duter|t=to doubt; to be afraid of, fear}} (compare {{cog|frm|doubter}}; modern {{cog|fr|douter|t=to doubt; to suspect}}); see further etymology above.<ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=''n.{{sup|1}}''|noformat=yes|id=57076|date=1897|nodot=yes}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=n}}</ref>

====Conjugation====
{{en-conj-simple}}

====Usage notes====
* This is generally a [[stative verb]] that rarely takes the continuous inflection. See [[:Category:English stative verbs]]
* In archaic usage, the phrase after "doubt" is what the doubter worries may be the case; in modern usage, that phrase is what the doubter worries may ''not'' be the case. Thus the archaic "I doubt he may be lying" is equivalent to the modern "I doubt he is telling the truth."
* In Scotland the archaic usage is still current but with a meaning boadened beyond worry: to doubt something is to consider it likely, so examples include not just "I doubt he's lying," but also "I doubt we'll arrive before dark."
