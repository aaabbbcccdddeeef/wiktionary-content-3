====Usage notes====
*In botanical usage, ''elliptic(al)'' refers only to the general shape of the [[leaf]], independently of its [[apex]] or [[margin]] (and sometimes the [[base]]), so that an "elliptic leaf" may very well be [[pointed]] at both ends.
*The form {{term|elliptic}} is more usual in mathematics.
