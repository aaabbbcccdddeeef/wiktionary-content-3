#*: If you want to colour your hair but achieve expensive looking results you don’t have many options. Either stay very close to your natural hair colour or visit a salon on a trainee night and choose something more adventurous. If '''DIYing''' you can use a permanent hair colour to cover grey or just give your hair even tone and gloss. <!-- [sic] the general punctuation shortage -->
