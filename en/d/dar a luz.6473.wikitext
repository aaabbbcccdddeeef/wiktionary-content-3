=== Verb ===
'''[[dar]] [[a]] [[luz]]'''

# {{esidiom}} To [[give birth]]. (Literally "to give light to")

=== Cultural note ===
*Spaniards often say the verb ''parir'' instead of ''dar a luz'', but it is frowned upon by Central- and South-Americans for ''parir'' is used when saying animals give birth. So, ''dar a luz'' is more commonly heard in Central- and South-America than in Spain.
