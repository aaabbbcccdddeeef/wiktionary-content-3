'''[[dar#Spanish|dar]] [[a#Spanish|a]] [[luz#Spanish|luz]]'''

# {{idiomatic|lang=es}} To [[give birth]]. (Literally "to give to light")

===Usage notes===
*Spaniards often say the verb ''parir'' instead of ''dar a luz'', but it is frowned upon by Central- and South-Americans for ''parir'' is used when saying animals give birth.  So, ''dar a luz'' is more commonly heard in Central- and South-America than in Spain.
