'''Dog and cat''' is a term used to refer to a male and female team, either as associates or where one is the second in command to the other, such as in an organization which deals with both men and women on personal terms, such as a health provider, the administrator might be a man or a woman, and the deputy administrator be of the other sex.

It has been popular in police organizations for decades to refer to a two-person police team which has both a male and a female member as a 'dog and cat team'.
