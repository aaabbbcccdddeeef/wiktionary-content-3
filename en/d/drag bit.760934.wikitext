{{en-noun}}[[Category:Move to Wiktionary 2007-09]]
A '''drag bit''' is a [[drill bit]] usually designed for use in soft formation, such as sand, clay, or some soft rock. Uses include drilling water wells, that consists of a [[drill pipe connector]] attached to blades on the end.  The cutting edge of the drag bit is often [[tungsten carbide]].  

A chevron bit is a type of drag bit designed for harder materials, commonly used for drilling [[oil well]]s.  Other types of drag bits include chevron, step, and scratcher.  Drag bits are generally used with Tungsten Carbide Inserts.

The drag bit thread: API Reg thread, API IF Thread, Arod thread, Nrod thread;
The drag bits wings: 2 wings drag bits, 3 wings drag bits, 4 wings drag bits;
The drag bits wings shape: step type; chevron type;
The drag bits materials: TC insert drag bits, PDC/PCD drag bits;
The drag bits size: 2" to 17 1/2" .
The drag bits also called clay bits.

The difference between step drag bits and chevron drag bits:
The chevron drag bits are recommended for drilling in slightly harder and more consolidated materials than step drag bits, such as hard shales, limestone, and tougher gravels, but the step drag bits is with the higher penetration speed and used for softer formations than chevron drag bits.
