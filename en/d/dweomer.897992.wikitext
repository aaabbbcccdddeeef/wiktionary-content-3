*''For the Dweomer magic of Katharine Kerr's Deverry books, see [[Dweomer (Deverry Cycle)]].''

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the Old English word ''dweomer'' meaning 'witchcraft' derives from the Old Norse term ''dvergmál'' literally meaning 'dwarf talk' (''dvergr'' dwarf + ''mál'' talk). This phrase "dwarf talk" is often used as the technical term for 'echo', but here refers to the secret knowledge of magic among the Dvergar. See for instance the entry, ''dweomercræft''.

In [[role-playing game]]s, like [[Dungeons & Dragons]], and in [[fantasy]] novels, a '''dweomer''' is the [[magical]] [[aura]] on an enchanted item. More broadly, it may refer to the aura of a [[Magic (gaming)|spell]] having been cast whose duration remains active.
