A '''dweomer''' is the [[magical]] charge on an enchanted item in [[fantasy]] books or [[role-playing game|RPGs]] such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. More broadly, it can refer to the magical item itself or a [[Magic (gaming)|spell]] cast by the object.

''Dweomer'' was an [[Old English]] word for sorcery or witchcraft; see, for instance, "dweomercraeft" in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].
