'''Dweomer''', according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], is the Old English word meaning 'witchcraft' that derives from the Old Norse term ''dvergmál'' literally meaning 'dwarf talk' (''dvergr'' dwarf + ''mál'' talk), referring to the secret knowledge of magic among the [[Norse]] [[dwarves]]. See for instance the entry, ''dweomercræft''. A related Middle English word that derives from the phrase 'dwarf talk', ''dwergma'', means 'echo', crediting the dwarves who live in the stones with the sound.

In [[role-playing game]]s, like [[Dungeons & Dragons]], and in [[fantasy]] novels, a '''dweomer''' is the [[magical]] [[aura]] on an enchanted item. More broadly, it may refer to the aura of a [[magic]] [[spell]] having been cast whose duration remains active.
