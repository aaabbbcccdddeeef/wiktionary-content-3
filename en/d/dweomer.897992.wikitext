A '''Dweomer''' is the [[magical]] charge on an enchanted item in [[fantasy]] books or [[role-playing game|RPGs]] such as [[Dungeons and Dragons]]. More broadly, it can refer to the magical item itself or a [[Magic (gaming)|spell]] cast by the object.

'Dweomer' was an [[Old English]] word for sorcery or witchcraft; see, for instance, 'dweomercraft' in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].
