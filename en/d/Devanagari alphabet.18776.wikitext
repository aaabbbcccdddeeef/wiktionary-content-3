'''[[Devanagari]] [[alphabet]]'''

# incorrect term sometimes used for the [[Devanagari]] writing script used for writing several [[Indian]] languages, including [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], [[Marathi]], [[Kashmiri]], [[Sindhi]], [[Bihari]], [[Bhili]], [[Konkani]], and [[Bhojpuri]]. It is also used to write [[Nepali]] in [[Nepal]]. It is an [[abugida]] writing system (not properly called an alphabet) because the base consonant characters include a default schwa vowel sound unless it is modified or removed.
