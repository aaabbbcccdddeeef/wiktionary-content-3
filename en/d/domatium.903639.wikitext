===Noun===
{{en-noun|domatia}}

# {{lb|en|entomology|botany}} A [[chamber]] produced by a [[plant]] in which [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, or [[fungus|fungi]] live. It typically takes the form of a [[hollow]] under a [[leaf]], or a system of tunnels in a [[thorn]] or [[stem]]. Ideally a domatium is a [[mutualistic]] [[adaptation]], not to be confused with simple damage by a [[borer]] or [[gall]]-forming [[pest]], though commonly there is no sharp distinction between domatia of value to the plant and galls caused by [[harmful]] aphids and mites for example.
