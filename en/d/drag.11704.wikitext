From {{inh|en|enm|draggen||to drag}}, early {{inh|en|enm|dragen||to draw, carry}}, confluence of {{inh|en|ang|dragan||to drag, draw, draw oneself, go, protract}} and {{der|en|non|draga||to draw, attract}}; both from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*draganą||to draw, drag}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dʰreǵʰ-||to draw, drag}}. Verb sense influenced due to association with the noun {{m|en|drag||that which is hauled or dragged}}, related to {{cog|nds|dragge||a drag-anchor, grapnel}}. Cognate with {{cog|da|drægge||to dredge}}, {{cog|da|drage||to draw, attract}}, {{cog|sv|dragga||to drag, drag anchor, sweep}}, {{cog|sv|draga||to draw, go}}, {{cog|is|draga||to drag, pull}}. {{doublet|en|draw}}.
