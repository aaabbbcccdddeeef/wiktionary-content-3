# {{label|en|physics|and|astrophysics}} An order or factor of ten. Used both to refer to the function <math>\mathrm{dex}(x) = 10^x</math> and the number of (possibly fractional) orders of magnitude separating two numbers. When dealing with [[log]] to the base 10 transform of a number set the transform of 10, 100, and 1 000 000 is <math>\log_{10}(10) = 1</math>, <math>\log_{10}(100) = 2</math>, and <math>\log_{10}(1 000 000) = 6</math>, so the difference between 10 and 100 in base 10 is 1 dex and the difference between 1 and 1 000 000 is 6 dex.
