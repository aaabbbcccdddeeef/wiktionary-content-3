# {{physics|and|astrophysics}} An order or factor of ten. Used both to refer to the function <math>dex(x) = 10^x</math> and the number of (possibly fractional) orders of magnitude separating two numbers.  When dealing with [[log]] to the base 10 transform of a number set the transform of 10, 100, and 1 000 000 is <math>\log_{10}(10) = 1</math>, <math>\log_{10}(100) = 2</math>, and <math>\log_{10}(1 000 000) = 6</math>, so the difference between 10 and 100 in base 10 is 1 dex and the difference between 1 and 1 000 000 is 6 dex.

#*: The data points for low-<nH> paths are scattered more widely than those for denser sight lines, because O/H ratios for such paths shorter than 800 pc are generally about 0.10 '''dex''' lower than the values for longer ones.
