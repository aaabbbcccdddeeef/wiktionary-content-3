'''DNA'''
{{wikipedia}}
#{{biology}}, {{genetics}} an abbreviation for [[deoxyribonucleic acid]], the [[genetic]] material of nearly all forms of [[life]]. DNA is used to [[store]] the [[genetic]] [[information]] of nearly all [[living]] [[organisms]], excepting some [[viruses]] that use [[RNA]] instead.
#{{biochemistry}} a [[biopolymer]] of [[Deoxyribonucleic acid]]s (a type of [[nucleic acid]]) that has four different [[chemical]] [[groups]], called [[bases]]: [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], and [[thymine]]. These [[bases]] are abbreviated A, G, C, and T, respectively. [[Linear]] [[polymer]] [[chain]]s of DNA [[encode]] [[sequence]]s of bases, e.g., "ATGGGCGGGTTT..." These [[DNA sequence]]s [[encode]] for [[gene]]s. [[Gene]]s in a [[DNA sequence]] [[encode]] for [[protein]]s and are the basis of [[heredity]], or [[genetic]] [[inheritence]]. [[Inherit]]ed DNA resides in [[chromosome]]s within the [[nucleus]] of the [[cell]]. These [[inherit]]ed DNA are [[double-stranded]], such that the second strand is a [[complement]] (or "[[mirror-image]]" copy) of the first strand. In this way, the bases pair uniquely and [[non-covalent]]ly with only one other partner to form [[base pair]]s: A's pair with T's and G's with C's. [[Structural biology]] shows that [[double-stranded]], base-paired DNA form a [[double-helix]]. In order for the DNA [[polymer]] to [[copy]] itself, or [[replicate]], these strands are separated and each is copied by [[polymerase]] [[enzyme]]s to create two identical copies of the original [[double-stranded]] DNA.
:''The human genome contains 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA, which encode some 30,000 genes. If the strands of DNA found in each cell of the body were stretched out in a line, the 46 chromosomes in the human genome would extend more than six feet. The length of DNA in a typical human (including all of its cells) would stretch more than 100 billion miles or more than 1000 times the distance between the earth and sun!''
