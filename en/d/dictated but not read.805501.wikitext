"'''Dictated but not read'''" is a phrase commonly used to sign off on correspondence where formality takes a backseat to speedy communications, or where such correspondance is routine. When this is not the case, it is a discourtesy to the recipient of the letter.<sup>1</sup>

This practice is used often within the medical community, though it's appropriateness is still under debate.<sup>2</sup>
