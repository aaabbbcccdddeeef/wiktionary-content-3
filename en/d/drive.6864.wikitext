====Usage notes====
* In connection with a mass-storage device, originally the word “drive” referred solely to the reading and writing mechanism. For the storage device itself, the word “[[disk]]” was used instead. This remains a valid distinction for components such as floppy drives or CD drives, in which the drive and the disk are separate and independent items. For other devices, such as hard disks and flash drives, the reading, writing and storage components are combined into an integrated whole, and cannot be separated without destroying the device. In these cases, the words “disk” and “drive” are used interchangeably.
