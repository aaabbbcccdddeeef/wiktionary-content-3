===Noun===
{{infl|en|noun|head=[[ducks]] [[on]] [[the]] [[pond]]}}

# {{AU}} {{non-gloss definition|A coded warning called out by men working in a [[shearing shed]] alerting each other that guests ("ducks") are present ("in the pond"), so that for politeness they can moderate their language, ie, avoid obscenities or subjects improper for mixed company}}.
#* '''1982''', Patsy Adam-Smith, ''The Shearers'', Thomas Nelson Australia, ISBN 0-17-005884-0, page 245.
#*: Usually the wool presser calls first, because most visitors to a shed come through the wool room.  ''''Ducks on the Pond'''!' he calls, and the warning is taken up again down along the shearing board.

===Synonyms===
*[[ducks have landed]], [[feathers flying]], [[they're on the pond]] <!-- this one and "ducks on the pond" are the most usual two forms -->
