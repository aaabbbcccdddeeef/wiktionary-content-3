# {{AU}} A conventional warning called out by men working in a [[shearing shed]] alerting each other that a woman is there, so that for politeness they can moderate their language, ie. avoid obscenities, or subjects improper for mixed company.
#: 1982: ''Usually the wool presser calls first, because most visitors to a shed come through the wool room.  'Ducks on the Pond!' he calls, and the warning is taken up again down along the shearing board.'' &mdash; Patsy Adam-Smith, ''The Shearers'', Thomas Nelson Australia, ISBN 0-17-005884-0, page 245.
