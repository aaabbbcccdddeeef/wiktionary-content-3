* ''Alle arbeiders, '''die''' staken, zullen op sancties moeten rekenen.''
*: All workers, '''who''' are on strike, should expect sanctions.

In the first sentence, only the workers on strike are advised to expect sanctions. In the second sentence, the parenthetical phrase indicates that all the workers are on strike, and should all expect sanctions.
