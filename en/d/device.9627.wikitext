===Usage notes===
Device, [[contrivance]]. Device implies more of inventive power, and contrivance more of skill and dexterity in execution. A device usually has reference to something worked out for exhibition or show; a contrivance usually respects the arrangement or disposition of things with reference to securing some end. Devices were worn by knights-errant on their shields; contrivances are generally used to promote the practical convenience of life. The word device is often used in a bad sense, particularly when the device is not an [[artifact]]; as, a crafty device.  Contrivance is almost always used in a good sense; as, a useful contrivance.  When contrivance is used in a bad sense it implies something that is overly artful or artificial.
