{{en-noun|democrac|ies}}

# Rule by the people, especially as a form of [[government]]; either directly, as in Ancient Greece, or through elected representatives as in many modern societies ([[representative democracy]]).
#* '''1866''', J. Arthur Partridge, ''On Democracy'', Trübner & Co., page 2:
#*: And the essential value and power of '''Democracy''' consists in this,—that it combines, as far as possible, power and organization ; THE SPIRIT, MANHOOD, ''is at one with'' THE BODY, ORGANIZATION. [....] '''Democracy''' is Government by the People.
#* '''1901''', ''The American Historical Review'', American Historical Association, page 260:
#*: The period, that is, which marks the transition from absolutism or aristocracy to '''democracy''' will mark also the transition from absolutist or autocratic methods of nomination to democratic methods.
#* '''1921''', James Bryce Bryce, ''Modern Democracies'', The Macmillan Company, page 1:
#*: A century ago there was in the Old World only one tiny spot in which the working of '''democracy''' could be studied.  A few of the ancient rural cantons of Switzerland had recovered their freedom after the fall of Napoleon, and were governing themselves as they had done from the earlier Middle Ages[...].  Nowhere else in Europe did the people rule.
# {{context|government}} A [[government]] under the direct or representative rule of the [[people]] of its jurisdiction.
#* '''2003''', Fareed Zakaria, ''The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad'', W. W. Norton & Company, page 13:
#*: In 1900 not a single country had what we would today consider a '''democracy''': a government created by elections in which every adult citizen could vote.
# {{rfv-sense}} Belief in political freedom and equality.
