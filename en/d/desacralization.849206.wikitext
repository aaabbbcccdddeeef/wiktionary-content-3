'''Desacralization''' occurs when a formerly dedicated religious structure such as a church or religious school is given over for another purpose outside of the particular religious organization which dedicated it for a sacred purpose.

Example: when several unused Roman Catholic Churches in France were converted to Mosques for Muslim use. Even though the buildings were still being used for religious services, to the Catholic Church they had been desacralized

Sacralization is the dedication to religious purpose.
