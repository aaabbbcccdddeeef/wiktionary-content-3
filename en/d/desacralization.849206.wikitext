[[Sanctification|Sacralization]] is the dedication to religious purpose.  '''Desacralization''' is the reverse process and occurs when a formerly dedicated religious structure such as a [[church]] or religious school is given over for another purpose outside of the particular religious organization which dedicated it for a sacred purpose.

Example: When several unused Roman Catholic Churches in France were converted to [[Mosques]] for Muslim use, even though the buildings were still being used for religious services, to the Catholic Church they had been desacralized.
