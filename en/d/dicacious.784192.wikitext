#*: So obstinate was this '''dicacious''' and pleonastic old man, in his struggles to monopolise the whole conversation in the ''salle-à-manger'', that upon a gentle, respectable, and seedy English clergyman, with the usual amount of wife and children, gliding in, and beginning quietly to converse with his family, he violently wrenched the newspaper from the hands of the nearest waiter, and read out loud, at the top of his voice, an entire leading article !
