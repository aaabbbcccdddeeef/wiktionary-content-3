This is an extension of the dualism concept widely discussed in [[development economics]]. In simple words it says that the relationship between the rich and the poor countries is just a global version of the [[dualism]] that we see in every aspect of life. The interrelations between the superior and inferior elements are such, be it in a global sense or in a local sense, that the superior elements does little or nothing to pull up the inferior element. In fact it may actually serve to push it down.
