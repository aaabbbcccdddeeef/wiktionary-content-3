'''Dimensioners''' are weighing and volume measuring devices or machines for measuring three dimensional or cube shaped objects such as packages, parcels, cartons or boxes. Some dimensioners not only measure the length, width, and height of packages, but their weight as well. Dimensioners are an important part of a much larger logistical system in a distriubtion center or warehouse.  They are usually installed as part of an automated system where conveyors allow objects to enter one area of the warehouse, and sorting systems distribute high volumes of objects to a variety of locations based on their weight and dimensions.
