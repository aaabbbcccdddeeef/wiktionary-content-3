===Alternative forms===
* {{l|en|doe}}

===Etymology 1===
{{PIE root|en|dʰeh₁}}
From {{inh|en|enm|don}}, from {{inh|en|ang|dōn}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dōną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-||to put, place, do, make}}.

The past tense form is from {{inh|en|enm|didde}}, {{m|enm|dude}}, from {{inh|en|ang|dyde}}, {{m|ang|*diede}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dedǭ}}/{{m|gem-pro|*dedē}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*dʰédʰeh₁ti}}, an athematic e-reduplicated verb of the same root {{m|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-}}.

According to [[w:John McWhorter|John McWhorter]] the use of ''do'' in interrogative and negative constructions is calqued from Celtic languages (such as Welsh).

=====Conjugation=====
{{en-conj|do|did|done|doing|does}}

=====Usage notes=====
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun {{m|en|thou}} was in active use, and verbs used {{m|en|-est}} for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb {{m|en||do}} had two such forms: {{m|en|dost}}, in auxiliary uses, and {{m|en|doest}}, in other uses. The past tense of both forms is {{m|en|didst}}.
* Similarly, when the ending {{m|en|-eth}} was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form {{m|en|doth}} was used as an auxiliary, and the form {{m|en|doeth}} elsewhere.

=====Antonyms=====
* {{l|en|don't}}

====Pronunciation====

====Particle====
{{head|ga|particle|triggers {{ga-mut-link|l}} of a following consonant}}

# {{lb|ga|Munster|literary}} {{non-gloss definition|relative marker (nominative, accusative)}}
#: {{ux|ga|an cailín '''do''' mholann sé|the girl that he praises|inline=1}}

=====Usage notes=====
The variant form, {{m|ga|d’}}, is required before verbs beginning with a vowel or ''fh'':
: {{ux|ga|'''d’'''ól sé|he drank|inline=1}}
: {{ux|ga|an fear '''d’'''fhreastlann sé|the man that he serves|inline=1}}

Unlike {{m|ga||do}}, {{m|ga||d’}} is not optional as a marker of the past tense.

The relative particle {{m|ga||do}} is most commonly pronounced {{IPAchar|/ə/}} (corresponding to the standard written Irish form {{m|ga|a}}, while {{m|ga||d’}} elides:

: {{ux|ga|an cailín '''a''' mholann sé|the girl that he praises}}
: {{ux|ga|an deoch ’ólann sé|the drink that he drinks}}

===Etymology===
{{PIE root|la|deh₃}}
From {{inh|la|itc-pro|*didō}}, from {{inh|la|ine-pro|*dédeh₃ti}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*deh₃-||give}}. The reduplication was lost in Latin, but is preserved in the other Italic languages. A root aorist (from {{cog|ine-pro|*déh₃t}}) is preserved in Venetic {{m|xve|tr=doto}}; the other Italic perfect forms reflect a reduplicated stative, {{m|itc-pro|*dedai}}. However, the root aorist possibly served as the source of the Latin present forms.<ref>{{R:De Vaan 2008}}</ref>

Cognates include Ancient Greek {{m|grc|δίδωμι}}, Sanskrit {{m|sa|ददाति|tr=dádāti}}, Old Persian {{m|peo|sc=Xpeo|𐎭𐎭𐎠𐎬𐎺|tr=dā-}}.
