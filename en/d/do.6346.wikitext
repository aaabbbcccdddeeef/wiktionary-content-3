===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|don}}, from {{inh|en|ang|dōn}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*dōn}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dōną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-||to put, place, do, make}}.

The past tense form is from {{inh|en|enm|didde}}, {{m|enm|dude}}, from {{inh|en|ang|dyde}}, {{m|ang|*diede}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dedǭ}}/{{m|gem-pro|*dedē}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*dʰédʰeh₁ti}}, an athematic e-reduplicated verb of the same root {{m|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-}}.

The use of ''do'' in interrogative, negative, and, formerly, affirmative sentences, unusual in Germanic languages, is thought by some linguists to be one of the {{w|Brittonicisms in English}}, calqued from [[Brythonic]].<ref>{{cite-book|author=John McWhorter|chapter=1|editor=|editors=|title=Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The Untold History of English
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LqJDQAAQBAJ|edition=reprint|location=United States of America|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|page=|pages=1–7|pageurl=|section=|isbn=1592404944|oclc=}}</ref> It is first recorded in Middle English, where it may have marked the [[perfective]] aspect, though in some cases the meaning seems to be [[imperfective]]. In {{w|Early Modern English}}, any meaning in such contexts was lost, making it a dummy auxiliary, and soon thereafter its use became mandatory in most questions and negation.

=====Usage notes=====
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun ''[[thou]]'' was in active use, and verbs used ''[[-est]]'' for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb ''do'' had two such forms: ''[[dost]]'', in auxiliary uses, and ''[[doest]]'', in other uses. The past tense of both forms is ''[[didst]]''.
* Similarly, when the ending ''[[-eth]]'' was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form ''[[doth]]'' was used as an auxiliary, and the form ''[[doeth]]'' was used elsewhere.

===Etymology===
{{root|la|ine-pro|*deh₃-}}
From {{inh|la|itc-pro|*didō}}, from {{inh|la|ine-pro|*dédeh₃ti}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*deh₃-||give}}. The reduplication was lost in Latin in the present tense, but is preserved in the other Italic languages. A root aorist (from {{cog|ine-pro|*déh₃t}}) is preserved in Venetic {{m|xve|𐌆𐌏𐌕𐌏}}; the other Italic perfect forms reflect a reduplicated stative, {{m|itc-pro|*dedai}}. However, the root aorist possibly served as the source of the Latin present forms.<ref>{{R:itc:EDL}}</ref>

Cognates include {{cog|grc|δίδωμι}}, {{cog|sa|ददाति|tr=dádāti}}, {{cog|peo|sc=Xpeo|𐎭𐎭𐎠𐎬𐎢𐎺|tr=dā-}}.
