=====Conjugation=====
{{en-conj|do|did|done|doing|does}}

=====Usage notes=====
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun {{term|thou|lang=en}} was in active use and verbs had a distinct second-person singular present-tense form, the verb {{term||do|lang=en}} had two such forms: {{term|dost|lang=en}}, in helping-verb uses, and {{term|doest|lang=en}}, in other uses. (Naturally, these are both now archaic, though {{term||doest|lang=en}} is less common than {{term||dost|lang=en}} even as an archaism.) Similarly, when the ending {{term|-eth|lang=en}} was in active use for third-person singular present-tense forms, the form {{term|doth|lang=en}} was used as a helping verb, and the form {{term|doeth|lang=en}} elsewhere; these have both been supplanted by the current form {{term|does|lang=en}}, except in archaisms, where {{term||doth|lang=en}} is more common than {{term||doeth|lang=en}}.

=====Usage notes=====
For the plural of the noun, the spelling {{term||dos|lang=en}} would be correct; {{term||do's|lang=en}} is often used for the sake of legibility, but is sometimes considered incorrect. For the party, the term is generally used only by older adults and usually implies a social function of modest size and formality.

===Etymology 2===
From the name of musicologist [[w:Giovanni Battista Doni|Giovanni Battista '''Do'''ni]], who suggested replacing the original {{term|ut|lang=it}} with an [[open syllable]] for ease of singing. First found in {{etyl|it|en}}.
