===Etymology 1===
{{wikipedia|Do-support}}

{{root|en|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-}}
From {{inh-lite|en|enm|don}}, from {{inh-lite|en|ang|don|dōn}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*dōn}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dōną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-||to put, place, do, make}}.

For senses 4 and 5, compare [[w:Old Norse|Old Norse]] ''[[duga#Old_Norse|duga]]'', whence [[w:Danish|Danish]] ''[[du#Danish|du]]''.

The past tense form is from {{inh-lite|en|enm|didde}}, {{m-lite|enm|dude}}, from {{inh-lite|en|ang|dyde}}, {{m|ang|*diede}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dedǭ}}/{{m|gem-pro|*dedē}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*dʰédʰeh₁ti}}, an athematic e-reduplicated verb of the same root {{m|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-}}.

The obligatory, meaningless use of ''do'' in interrogative, negative, and—formerly—affirmative sentences, existing in some form in most Germanic languages<ref name=Langer>{{cite book|last=Langer |first=Nils |title=Linguistic Purism in Action: How auxiliary tun was stigmatized in Early New High German |year=2001 |publisher=de Gruyter |isbn=9783110881103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZUiAAAAQBAJ}}</ref>, is thought by some linguists to be one of the {{w|Brittonicisms in English}}, calqued from [[Brythonic]].<ref>{{cite-journal|author=John McWhorter|title=What else happened to English? A brief for the Celtic hypothesis|journal=English language & linguistics|location=Cambridge|publisher=University Press|date=2009|volume=13|issue=2|pages=163-191}}</ref> It is first recorded in Middle English, where it may have marked the [[perfective]] aspect, though in some cases the meaning seems to be [[imperfective]]. In {{w|Early Modern English}}, any meaning in such contexts was lost, making it a dummy auxiliary, and soon thereafter its use became mandatory in most questions and negations.

Doublets include {{m-lite|en|deed}}, {{m-lite|en|deem}}, {{m-lite|en|-dom}}, but not {{m-lite|en|deal}}.

Other cognates include, via Latin, {{cog-lite|en|feast}}, {{m-lite|en|festival}}, {{m-lite|en|fair||celebration}}, via Greek, {{cog-lite|en|theo-}}, {{m-lite|en|theme}}, {{m-lite|en|thesis}}, and {{cog|sa|दधाति||to put}}, {{m|sa|धातृ||creator}} and {{m|sa|धातु||layer, element, root}}.

=====Usage notes=====
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun ''[[thou]]'' was in active use, and verbs used ''[[-est]]'' for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb ''do'' had two such forms: ''[[dost]]'', in auxiliary uses, and ''[[doest]]'', in other uses. The past tense of both forms is ''[[didst]]''.
* Similarly, when the ending ''[[-eth]]'' was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form ''[[doth]]'' was used as an auxiliary, and the form ''[[doeth]]'' was used elsewhere.

===Etymology===
{{root|la|ine-pro|*deh₃-}}
From {{inh|la|itc-pro|*didō}}, from {{inh|la|ine-pro|*dédeh₃ti}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*deh₃-||give}}. The reduplication was lost in Latin in the present tense, but is preserved in the other Italic languages. A root aorist (from {{cog|ine-pro|*déh₃t}}) is preserved in Venetic {{m|xve|𐌆𐌏𐌕𐌏}}; the other Italic perfect forms reflect a reduplicated stative, {{m|itc-pro|*dedai}}. However, the root aorist possibly served as the source of the Latin present forms.<ref>{{R:itc:EDL}}</ref>

Cognates include {{cog|grc|δίδωμι}}, {{cog|sa|ददाति|tr=dádāti}}, {{cog|peo|sc=Xpeo|𐎭𐎭𐎠𐎬𐎢𐎺|tr=dā-}}.

Is not this a substitution of a new law for the laws of Cæsar, which enact that every man who has been convicted of violence, and also every man who has been convicted of treason, shall be interdicted from fire and water? And, when those men have a right of appeal '''granted''' them, are not the acts of Cæsar rescinded? And those acts, O conscript fathers, I, who never approved of them, have still thought it advisable to maintain for the sake of concord; so that I not only did not think that the laws which Cæsar had passed in his lifetime ought to be repealed, but I did not approve of meddling with those even which since the death of Cæsar you have seen produced and published.}}

====Conjugation====
In Vulgar Latin, ''dō'' becomes ''*dao'', by analogy with the root vowel ''-a-'', but also by some elided third conjugation verbs like ''*vao'', ''*vare'' (< {{m-lite|la|vado|vadō, vadere}}).

This table includes an archaic present subjunctive conjugation on a ''du-'' root that appears in the works of Plautus and Terence.
