=====Conjugation=====
{{en-conj|do|did|done|doing|does}}

=====Usage notes=====
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun {{m|en|thou}} was in active use, and verbs used {{m|en|-est}} for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb {{m|en||do}} had two such forms: {{m|en|dost}}, in auxiliary uses, and {{m|en|doest}}, in other uses. The past tense of both forms is {{m|en|didst}}. 
* Similarly, when the ending {{m|en|-eth}} was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form {{m|en|doth}} was used as a helping verb, and the form {{m|en|doeth}} elsewhere.

For the plural of the noun, the spelling {{m|en||dos}} would be correct; {{m|en||do's}} is often used for the sake of legibility, but is sometimes considered incorrect. For the party, the term is generally used only by older adults and usually implies a social function of modest size and formality.
