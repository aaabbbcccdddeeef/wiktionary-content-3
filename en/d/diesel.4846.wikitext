===Verb===
{{en-verb}}

# To ignite a substance by using the heat generated by compression.
# {{automotive}} For a spark-ignition [[internal combustion engine]] to continue running after the electrical current to the spark plugs has been turned off.  This occurs when there's enough heat in the combustion chamber to ignite the air/fuel without a spark, the same way heat and pressure cause ignition in a [[diesel engine]].
#: The only reason the VW bug has a solenoid is to prevent it from '''dieseling'''.
