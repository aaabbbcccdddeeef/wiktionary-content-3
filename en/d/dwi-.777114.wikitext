In [[chemistry]], the prefix '''dwi-''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "two") was formerly used to name undiscovered [[chemical element]]s lying two periods under a known element in the [[periodic table]]. For example, [[rhenium]] was called dwi-[[manganese]] before its discovery in 1926.
Current official [[IUPAC]] practice is to use a [[systematic element name]] based on the [[atomic number]] of the element as the provisional name, instead of being based on its position in the periodic table as these prefixes require.
