# {{chemistry|dated}} In [[chemistry]], a [[designation]] prefix for undiscovered [[chemical]] [[element]]s lying two periods under a known element in the [[periodic table]]. (For example, [[rhenium]] was called [[dwi-manganese]] before its discovery in 1926.

====Usage notes====
Current official [[IUPAC]] practice is to use a [[systematic]] element name based on the [[atomic number]] of the element as the [[provisional]] name, instead of being based on its position in the periodic table as these prefixes require.
