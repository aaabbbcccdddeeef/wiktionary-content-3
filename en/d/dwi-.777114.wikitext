In [[chemistry]], the prefix '''dwi-''' was formerly used to name undiscovered [[chemical element]]s which are two periods under a discovered chemical element in the [[periodic table]]. For example, [[rhenium]] was called dwi-[[manganese]] before its discovery in 1926.

Current practice is to use [[systematic element name]]s for undiscovered elements.
