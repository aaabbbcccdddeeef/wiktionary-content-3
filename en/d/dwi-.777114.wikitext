In [[chemistry]], the prefix '''dwi-''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "two") was formerly used to name undiscovered [[chemical element]]s lying two periods under a known element in the [[periodic table]]. For example, [[rhenium]] was called dwi-[[manganese]] before its discovery in 1926.

Current practice is to use [[systematic element name]]s for undiscovered elements.
