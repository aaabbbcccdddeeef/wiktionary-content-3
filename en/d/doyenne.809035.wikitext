'''Doyenne''' is a [[French language|French]] term meaning "oldest woman" (the word for "oldest man" is 'doyen'). It is used in sentences such as "[[Jeanne Calment]], ''la 'doyenne' de l' humanit√©''". Ironically, there is no word in the English language for "oldest person" (the [[English language]] has far more words). The word has been used in print in English for some time. For example, [[Helen Thomas]] is frequently referred to as the ''doyenne'' of the White House press corps.
