==Ancient Greek==
{{wikipedia|Orontid dynasty}}
{{wikipedia|Orontes River}}

===Etymology===
The king's name derives from {{der|grc|xme-old|sc=Latn|*Arēvand}}, from {{der|grc|ira-pro|*Raivant-}}, {{m|ira-pro|*Rayivant-||possessing wealth}}; see {{cog|xcl|Երուանդ}} for more.

The river is of disputed etymology, {{der|grc|akk|𒀀𒊏𒀭𒌓|tr=Arāntu|t=Orontes; site of the {{w|Battle of Qarqar}}}} and also in {{der|grc|egy|jrnt|tr=Arantu/Araunti|t=Orontes; river flowing by {{w|Kadesh_(Syria)|Qadesh}}}} attested at least from the period of {{w|Ramesses II}}:
* The meaning of which is contested with connections to: {{noncog|akk|𒀀𒊏𒀭𒌓|tr=arantu|t=a type of grass; fennel}}, perhaps in connection to the region around the city of {{w|Ugarit}}, the ruins today being known as {{m|ar|رَأْس شَمْرَة‎|tr=|t=Headland or Cape Fennel}}.
* Also connected to {{noncog|akk|𒀀𒊏𒀭𒁺|tr=araddu, arantu|t=wild ass; stubborn}}, possibly related to the modern name for the river {{m|ar|عَاصِي‎|tr=|t=rebel, stubbornly in error, refusing to be corrected}} so-called for its flowing south to the north unlike the rest of the rivers in the region.
* The river is disputably from {{der|grc|xme-old|sc=Latn|*Arvand}}; compare {{cog|ae||𐬀𐬎𐬭𐬎𐬎𐬀𐬧𐬝-|swift}}.
