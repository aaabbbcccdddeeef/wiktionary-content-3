# A philosophical movement formed as a cultural reaction against [[positivism]] in the early 20th century.
#* {{quote-book|year=1964 |title=Cross Currents of Psychiatry and Catholic Morality |author=|page=351|lang=en |ISBN=|passage=Finally, with good reason, this psychology aims to be a psychology of a purely empiriological type. It is pervaded and overwhelmed on every side, however, by a pseudometaphysics of the most vulgar character, which Freud is all the less anxious to dispense iwth as he imagines he has no philosophy or metaphysics at all. I say pseudometaphysics of the most vulgar type, because it combines all the prejudices of deterministic, mechanistic scientism with all the prejudices of '''irrationalism'''. }}
