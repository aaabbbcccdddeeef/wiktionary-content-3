====Usage notes====
"In My Humble Opinion" seems to be the original sense, present in sources dating back to 1986. The origin of the second sense ("Honest") is not known but this use is present in sources as early as 1994. Some authors speculate that the second sense may have arisen out of confusion with [[TBH]], or because the opinions offered often turned out not to be so humble after all. Caution is recommended where the meaning is not clear from context.
