====Usage notes====
"In My Humble Opinion" seems to be the original sense, present in sources dating back to a Usenet group response on Feb 23, 1984. (From OED)

Re: Info wanted on Beta Tapes in net.video (Usenet newsgroup) 23 Feb.   The Sony and Maxell tapes are, imho [in my honest opinion], almost indistinguishable in quality, and are the only kind I buy now.

The origin of the second sense ("Honest") is not known but the use is present in sources as early as 1994. Some authors speculate that the second sense may have arisen out of confusion with [[TBH]], or because the opinions offered often turned out not to be so humble after all. Caution is recommended where the meaning is not clear from context.
