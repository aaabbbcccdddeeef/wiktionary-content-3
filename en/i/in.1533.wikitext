In older texts, the ''n'' is spelled together with a vowel-initial word (e.g. {{m|ga|i n-aice le}} instead of modern {{m|ga|in aice le||beside}} and {{m|ga|[[i]] [[nÉirinn]]}} or {{m|ga|[[i]] [[n-Éirinn]]}} instead of modern {{m|ga|in [[Éirinn]]||in Ireland}}. Also in older texts, {{m|ga|in [[bhur]]}} may be spelled {{m|ga|[[i]] [[nbhur]]}}.
