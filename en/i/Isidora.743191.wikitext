History (breaf)

Originates from Ancient Greece, as well as Teodora, Dorotea and their masculine varieties - Isidor, Teodor, Dorotej. 
Isidora is basically a variety from Teodora. In Greek (Teo - god, Dora - gift) the name 'Teodora' literally means 'a gift from gods', or 'the one the gods are fond of'. This name was often given to children who were wanted and long expected, or survived a difficult pregnancy. 
At some point, allong with the expansion of greek empire, a strong cult of Egyptian goddes Isis (fertility) has spread up in Greece. The name 'Teodora' suffered a modification to 'Isidora', changing its meaning from 'the gift of gods' to 'the gift of Isis'. The two names stayed in use untill today, aldough 'Teodora' is more common than 'Isidora'.
