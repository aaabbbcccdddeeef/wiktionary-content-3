{{en-adj}}thickened by dehydration. Specifically used when heating high-protein containing media; for example to enable recovery of bacteria for testing.

A common example of inspissation is frying an egg; the loss of water from the protein causes the egg to thicken from a gelatinous fluid to a solid.
