===Alternative forms===
* {{l|en|ilke}}

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|ilke}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|ilca|}}, conjectured as from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*ilīkaz}}, a compound of {{m|gem-pro|*iz}} and {{m|gem-pro|*-līkaz}} from the noun {{m|gem-pro|*līką||body}}.

The sense of “type”, “kind” is from the application of the phrase ‘{{m|en|of that ilk}}’ to families: the word thus came to mean ‘{{m|en|family}}’.

That makes him a servant of the '''powers-that-be''' that have no time for Nobby and his scrounging '''ilk'''. }}

====Usage notes====
* In modern use, ''ilk'' is used in phrases such as ''of his ilk'', {{m|en|of that ilk}}, to mean ‘type’ or ‘sort.’ The use arose out of a misunderstanding of the earlier, Scottish use in the phrase ''of that ilk'', where it means ‘of the same name or place.’ For this reason, some traditionalists regard the modern use as incorrect. It is, however, the only common current use and is now part of standard English.
