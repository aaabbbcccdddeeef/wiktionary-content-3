===Etymology===
Alteration influenced by {{etyl|ML.|en}} {{term|indorso|indorsare|lang=la}} of {{etyl|enm|en}} {{term|endosse|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|fro|en}} {{term|endosser||to put on back|lang=fro}}, from {{etyl|la|en}} {{term|dossum|lang=la}}, alternative form of {{term|dorsum||lang=la|back}},<ref>{{R:Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> from which also {{term|dorsal||of the back|lang=en}}. That is, the ‘r’ was dropped in Latin ''dossum,'' which developed into Old French and then Middle English ''endosse,'' and then the ‘r’ was re-introduced into English via the Medieval Latin ''indorsare,'' which had retained the ‘r’; at the same time the ‘e’ (French) was changed to ‘i’ (Latin) ({{term|in-|lang=en}}, rather than {{term|en-|lang=en}}). Note that the alternative form {{term|endorse|lang=en}} is now more common, retaining the restored ‘r’ but reverting to the initial ‘e’, rather than the Latinate ‘i’.
