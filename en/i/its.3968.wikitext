===Etymology===
Probably by analogy with possessives ending in {{term|'s}}.  There is no apostrophe, by analogy with {{term|his}}, {{term|hers}}, {{term|yours}}, etc. and to distinguish the pronoun from the contraction {{term|it's||it is, it has}}.  Note that the corresponding Old English and Middle English genitive form is {{term|his}}.

===Usage notes===
* {{term|its|Its}} is the possessive form of {{term|it}}. {{term|its|Its}} therefore does not require an apostrophe to indicate possession as it is already a possessive term, similar to {{term|his}} and {{term|hers}}.
* {{term|it's|It's}} is a [[contraction]] of "it is" or "it has."
*: "It's going to rain" is equivalent to "it is going to rain."
* {{term|its|Its}} can function as a possessive pronoun and a possessive adjective.  Its form is the same when used in either case. However, {{term|its|Its}} is extremely rare as a pronoun.
