===Etymology===
Probably by analogy with possesives ending in [['s]].  There is no apostrophe, by analogy with [[his]]/[[her]]/[[yours]]/etc. and to distinguish the pronoun from the contraction [[it's]].  Note that the corresponding Old English and Middle English genitive form is ''his''.

===Usage note===
*[[Its]] is the possessive form of [[it]]: ''its'' therefore does not require an appostrophe to indicate possession as it is already a possessive term, similar to [[his]] and [[hers]].
*[[It's]] is a [[contraction]] of "it is" or "it has."
*:"It's going to rain" is equivalent to "it is going to rain."
*[[Its]] can function as a possessive pronoun and a possessive adjective.  Its form is the same when used in either case.
