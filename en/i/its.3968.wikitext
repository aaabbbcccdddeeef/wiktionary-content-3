==English==

===Etymology===
Probably by analogy with possesives ending in [['s]].  There is no apostrophe, by analogy with [[his]]/[[her]]/[[yours]]/etc. and to distinguish the pronoun from the contraction [[it's]].  Note that the corresponding Old English and Middle English genitive form is ''his''.
