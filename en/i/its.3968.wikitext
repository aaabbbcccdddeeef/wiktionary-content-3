===Etymology===
Equivalent to {{affix|en|it|-'s}}. From the earlier form {{m|en|it's}} ({{compound|en|it|'s}}), which is now considered nonstandard. Began to displace {{m|en|his}} as the possessive of the neuter pronoun in the Middle English period; had fully displaced it by the 1700s.<ref>{{R:Etymonline}}</ref>

# The one (or ones) belonging to it. {{defdate|from 17th c.}}
#* '''1645''', Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton, [http://books.google.se/books?id=D8o9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA158 Letter to Ferdinando Fairfax], 6 February 1645:
#*: [...] both Houses have resolved to rob the North of a good friend of '''its''' and yours.
#* '''2007''' — Ian Austen, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01ebay.html "Canadian Court Opens Up eBay Data to Tax Agency"], ''New York Times'', October 1, 2007:
#*: EBay Canada argued in court that the data sought by tax collectors was not '''its''' to give.
#* '''1917''' — Charles Henry Taylor, [http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofboardof02tayl#page/1259/mode/1up ''History of the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago'' Vol.2 p.1259]:
#*: ...the Board of Trade of Chicago can at least feel that it has played its part manfully and patriotically, and that no act of '''its''' has stood in the way of National victory.

====Usage notes====
* In practice, ''its'' is commonly used as a determiner before a noun, but its use as a solo pronoun is generally avoided.
* ''Its'' is now distinguished from {{m|en|it's}} (a [[contraction]] of "it is" or "it has"). For example, '''''It's''' going to rain'' is equivalent to '''''It is''' going to rain'', and '''''It's''' been raining for hours'' is equivalent to '''''It has''' been raining for hours.'' However, the two are commonly confused, and using ''its'' where there should be ''it's'' (or vice versa) is a common mistake in written English.
* Like ''it'', ''its'' is usually avoided when referring to humans. ''Its'' is commonly used with animals when the gender is unknown or unimportant. With humans, {{m|en|person}} is used for a person whose gender is unknown or to refer to something that could be possessed by either gender, {{m|en|body}} or {{m|en|corpse}} is often used to refer to a dead person, and {{m|en|figure}}, {{m|en|shape}}, and {{m|en|silhouette}} are often used to refer to what someone sees as a person but can't see clearly enough to determine an identity or gender, e.g. ''The '''figure''' moved behind a bush, but Josh could see '''its''' shadow from the moonlight.''
