===Etymology===
Probably by analogy with possessives ending in {{term|'s}}.  There is no apostrophe, by analogy with {{term|his}}, {{term|hers}}, {{term|yours}}, etc. and to distinguish the pronoun from the contraction {{term|it's||it is, it has}}.  Note that the corresponding Old English and Middle English genitive form is {{term|his}}.

''Its'' can function as either a [[possessive adjective]] or a [[possessive pronoun]]. Its form is the same when used in either case. While common as a possessive adjective, ''its'' is extremely rare as a possessive pronoun.

===Pronoun===

# {{term|its|Its}} is extremely rare as a pronoun, the pronoun {{term|it}} being very rarely stressed. There is also very rarely a need for ''its'' as a possessive pronoun.

* The related but different term {{term|it's}} is a [[contraction]] of "it is" or "it has". For example, '''''It's''' going to rain'' is equivalent to '''''It is''' going to rain'', and '''''It's''' got three wheels'' is equivalent to '''''It has''' three wheels.''
* Like ''it'', ''its'' is usually avoided when referring to humans. ''Its'' is commonly used with animals when the gender is unknown or unimportant. With humans, {{term|person}} is used for a person whose gender is unknown or to describe something that could be possessed by either gender, {{term|body}} or {{term|corpse}} are often used to describe a dead person, and {{term|figure}}, {{term|shape}}, and {{term|silhouette}} are often used to describe what someone sees as a person but can't see clearly enough to determine an identity or gender, e.g. ''The '''figure''' moved behind a bush, but Josh could see '''its''' shadow from the moonlight.''
