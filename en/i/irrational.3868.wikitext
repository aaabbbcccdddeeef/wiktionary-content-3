===Etymology===

From ancient Greece
circa 500 B.C.
"Irrational" originally meant only that a number could not be expressed as a ratio. But for the pythagoreans it came to mean something threatening, a hint that their world view might not make sense, which is today the other meaning of "irrational".

* [[ir-]] + [[rational]]
