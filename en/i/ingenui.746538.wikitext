'''INGENUI''', is a term from the civil law referring to freemen who were born free. They were a class of freemen, distinguished from those who, born slaves, had afterwards legally obtained their freedom. The latter were called at various periods, sometimes ''[[liberti]]'', sometimes ''[[liberti|libertini]]''. 

An unjust or illegal servitude did not prevent a man from being ''[[ingenuus]]''.
