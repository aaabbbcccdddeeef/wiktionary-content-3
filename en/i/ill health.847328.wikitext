# {{lb|en|idiomatic}} A state of [[illness]], or bad health.
#: ''I have to cancel my holidays due to continuing '''ill health'''.''
<!--I make this entry as idiomatic as the term is confusing for English L2 speakers, because "bad health" is expected. The coupling of "ill" + "health" is contradictory.-->
