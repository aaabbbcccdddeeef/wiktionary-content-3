===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[ill]] [[health]]|-}}

# {{idiom}} A state of [[illness]], or bad health. 
#:''I have to cancel my holidays due to continuing '''ill health'''.''

<!--I make this entry as idiomatic as the term is confusing for English L2 speakers, because "bad health" is expected. The coupling of "ill" + "health" is contradictory.-->
