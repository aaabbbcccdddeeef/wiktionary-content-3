Primarily used to manage deep chronic pain. INF current uses very high pulse rate, usually 4001-4150 pulses per second. This higher frequency goes through the skin and muscle better than TENS or other modalities, thus can be more effective in pain control. Provides more analgesic, or nerve blocking effect. Device features include adjustable pulse rate, two or foue electrode treatment selection, and modulation of pulse rate. Because of such frequency, these devices will require a lot of power. Batteries will not last long. AC Adapters are usually suggested for use with interferential devices. Electrode placement should be in an "X" pattern, over the pain site,  as the point of intersection provides a third stronger frequency.
