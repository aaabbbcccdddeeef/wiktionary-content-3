===Etymology===
From {{F.}} ''[[illicite]]'', from {{L.}} ''[[illicitus]]'', from ''in-'' 'not' + ''licitus'' 'allowed'.

===Pronunciation===
*{{IPA|/ɪˈlɪsɪt/}}, {{SAMPA|/I"lIsIt/}}
*:Rhymes: [[Rhymes:English:-ɪsɪt|-ɪsɪt]]

===Adjective===
'''illicit'''

# {{law}} Lacking [[licitness]], but not [[invalid]].
#:''The bigamous marriage, while [[illicit]], was not invalid.''
# Breaking social norms.
# Unlawful.

====Usage notes====
[[licit|Licit]] and [[valid]] are legal terms to be compared, especially in terms of [[canon law]]. With [[bigamy]], if there is an innocent party, the innocent party is validly married; the problem is with the guilty party, who has entered into an illegal second marriage without first divorcing the earlier spouse. The marriage is valid in canon law (and often, civil law), but the guilty party goes to jail nonetheless, in that the marriage is [[illicit]] (and illegal), and the innocent party routinely receives a fast [[annulment]] and the full sympathy of the court. A [[corollary]] is that the children born of such unions are [[inherently]] [[legitimate]].

====Synonyms====
*[[criminal]]
*[[illegal]]
*[[illegitimate]]
*[[prohibited]]
