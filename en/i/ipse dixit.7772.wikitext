|passage=Mr. Lincoln has not character enough for integrity and truth, merely on his own '''''ipse dixit''''', to arraign President Buchanan, President Pierce, and nine Judges of the Supreme Court, not one of whom would be complimented by being put on an equality with him. There is an unpardonable presumption in a man putting himself up before thousands of people, and pretending that his '''''ipse dixit''''', without proof, without fact, and without truth, is enough to bring down and destroy the purest and best of living men.
