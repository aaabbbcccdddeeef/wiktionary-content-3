#*:Mr. Lincoln has not character enough for integrity and truth, merely on his own '''''ipse dixit''''', to arraign President Buchanan, President Pierce, and nine Judges of the Supreme Court, not one of whom would be complimented by being put on an equality with him.

# An authority who makes such an assertion.
