===Prepositional phrase===
{{en-PP}}

# [[really]], [[in effect]]. Not [[hypothetically]].
#: ''The new tax should have helped the farming community. But '''in practice''' farmers generally appear to be worse off than before.''
#* '''12 July 2012''', Sam Adams, AV Club ''Ice Age: Continental Drift''
#*: On paper, Continental Drift boasts a jaw-dropping voice cast, including but not limited to Jennifer Lopez, Patrick Stewart, Wanda Sykes, Aziz Ansari, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and Alan Tudyk. But '''in practice''', the overstuffed ensemble leaves the cast no room to distinguish themselves, and directors Steve Martino and Michael Thurmeier don’t seem interested in coaxing performances that might render their money stars less identifiable.
