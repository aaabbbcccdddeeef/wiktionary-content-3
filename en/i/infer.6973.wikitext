#* '''1603''', John Florio, translating Michel de Montaigne, ''Essays'', II.3:

====Usage notes====
There are two ways in which the word "infer" is sometimes used as if it meant "[[imply]]".  "[[implication|Implication]]" is done by a person when making a "[[statement]]", whereas "inference" is done to a preposition after it had already been made or assumed.  Secondly, the word "infer" can sometimes be used to mean "[[allude]]" or "[[express]]" in a suggestive manner rather than as a direct "statement".  Using the word "infer" in this sense is now generally considered incorrect. [http://www.askoxford.com/betterwriting/classicerrors/confused/?view=uk] [http://englishplus.com/grammar/00000232.htm]
