===Etymology===
{{PIE root|en|bʰer}}
From {{bor|en|la|inferō}}, from {{der|en|la|in-|id=in|gloss=in, at, on; into}} + {{der|en|la|ferō|gloss=bear, carry; suffer}} (cognate to Old English {{m|ang|beran}}, whence English {{m|en|bear}}), from {{der|en|itc-pro|*ferō}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*bʰéreti||to bear, carry}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*bʰer-}}. Literally “carry forward”, equivalent to “bear in”, as in concluding from a premise.

====Usage notes====
There are two ways in which the word "infer" is sometimes used as if it meant "[[imply]]". "[[implication|Implication]]" is done by a person when making a "[[statement]]", whereas "inference" is done to a proposition after it had already been made or assumed. Secondly, the word "infer" can sometimes be used to mean "[[allude]]" or "[[express]]" in a suggestive manner rather than as a direct "statement". Using the word "infer" in this sense is now generally considered incorrect. [http://www.askoxford.com/betterwriting/classicerrors/confused/?view=uk] [http://englishplus.com/grammar/00000232.htm]
