{{see|ie|IE|-ie}}
==English==

===Etymology===
From the Latin [[id est]], meaning “that is”.

==={{abbreviation}}===
'''i.e.'''

# That is, in other words, that is to say; in essence.

====Usage notes====
*Use '''i.e.''' to explain or clarify a statement by either (exhaustively) listing options or by rephrasing the previous statement.
*Always follow '''i.e.''' by a [[comma]] when used in its function as a clarifier.
*When used in a sentence, '''i.e.''' should be used parenthetically ('''i.e.''', embraced in parentheses).
*Opinion is mixed about whether the abbreviation should be italicized, or whether there should be a separating non-breaking space as in '''i.&nbsp;e.'''.
*'''ie:''' is often found in current usage, and is perhaps now considered acceptable.
