#* {{quote-book|year=1974|author=Thomas S. Szasz, M.D.|title=The Myth of Mental Illness|chapter=8|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Mental_Illness|isbn=0-06-091151-4|page=144}}
#*: Institutionally based, restrictive relationships, such as those<br> among family members or professional colleagues, must thus<br> be contrasted with '''instrumentally''' based, nonrestrictive rela-<br> tionships serving the aims of practical pursuits, such as those<br> between freely practicing experts and their clients or between<br> sellers and buyers. In '''instrumentally''' structured situations it is<br> not necessary for the participants to curb their needs, because<br> the mere expression of needs in no way compels others to<br> gratify them, as it tends to do in the family.<sup><small>19</small></sup> Indeed, not<br> only is the frank expression of needs not inhibited, but it is<br> often encouraged, since it helps to identify a problem or need<br> for which someone might have a solution or satisfaction.
#: They will argue that the end being essentially beneficial, the means become '''instrumentally''' so 
# With instruments of music;
