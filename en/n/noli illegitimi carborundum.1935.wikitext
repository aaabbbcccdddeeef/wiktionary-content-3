===Etymology===
Humorous pseudo-Latin, derived from {{m|la|noli||[[do]] [[not]] [[permit]]}} [singular] and {{m|la|illegitimi||[[bastard]]s}} [in the wrong grammatical case] and from the Latinate {{der|la|en|carborundum}}, a [[brand name]] for a silicon carbide abrasive.

This form of the saying was popularized in English by the US general [[:w:"Vinegar Joe" Stilwell|"Vinegar Joe" Stilwell]] during [[:w:World War II|World War II]], reputed to have been taught it by British army intelligence. It later became the motto for the 1964 [[:w:Republican Party (US)|Republican]] presidential nominee [[:w:Barry Goldwater|Barry Goldwater]], who displayed it as a sign in his senatorial office. The plural form ''nolite te bastardes carborundum'' was popularized by [[:w:Margaret Atwood|Margaret Atwood]]'s 1985 dystopian novel ''[[:w:The Handmaid's Tale|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' and its subsequent TV adaptation.
