===Etymology===
Pseudo-Latin

===Phrase===
'''[[noli]] [[illegitimi]] [[carborundum]]'''

# [[don't|Don't]] [[let]] [[the]] [[bastard]]s [[wear]] [[you]] [[down]].

'''Note:  ''' This saying (in the first variant above?) was popularized by US General "Vinegar Joe" Stillwell during World War II.  He is reputed to have learned it from British army intelligence.  In politics, the saying became motto for 1964 Republican nominee Senator Barry Goldwater, who hung a sign in his office. The word "[[carborundum]]" in particular was not of Latin origin. ''Carborundum'', is often represented as meaning ''grind'' resulting in ''Don't let the bastards '''grind''' you''.

===Alternative spellings===
* illegitimis non carborundum
* nil illegitimi carborundum
* non illegitimi carborundum
* nil carborundum illegitimi
