===Etymology===
Pseudo-Latin.

This saying was popularized by US General "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell during World War II. He is reputed to have learned it from British army intelligence. In politics, the saying became motto for 1964 Republican nominee Senator Barry Goldwater, who hung a sign in his office. The word "[[carborundum]]" in particular was not of Latin origin. <ref>The use of the word Carborundum is a pun, a brand name of a form of silicon carbide grinding material</ref> ''Carborundum'' is often represented as meaning ''grind'', resulting in ''Don't let the bastards '''grind''' you down''.The correct translation is ''noli nothis permittere te terere''.
