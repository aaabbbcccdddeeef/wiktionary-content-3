Noroviruses are named after the "Norwalk virus," which caused an outbreak of illness in Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968. Norovirus infection is the most common nonbacterial cause of gastroenteritis, a condition involving inflammation of the stomach and intestines.

An estimated 23 million cases of norovirus infection occur in the United States each year. Noroviruses are hardy and difficult to eradicate, although certain precautions can help prevent the virus from spreading.
