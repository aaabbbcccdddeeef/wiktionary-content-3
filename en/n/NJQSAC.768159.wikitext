NJQSAC - New Jersey Quality Single Accountability Continuum

In September 2007, the state of New Jersey will begin phasing in the new school district monitoring system, the New Jersey Quality Single Accountability Continuum (NJQSAC). This will have local school boards use a completely new approach to assessing progress in the areas of academic achievement, board governance, district administration, finances and facilities.
