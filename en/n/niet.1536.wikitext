* {{audio|Nl-niet.ogg|audio}}
* {{IPA|/nit/|lang=nl}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|dum|nl}} {{term|niwet|lang=dum}}, {{term|niet|lang=dum}}, from {{etyl|odt|nl}} *{{term||niowiht|lang=odt}}, {{term|niewiht|lang=odt}}, from {{term|nio||never|lang=odt}} + {{term|wiht||thing, creature|lang=odt}}. The former in turn derives from {{proto|Germanic|ne|not|lang=nl}} + {{proto|Germanic|aiw-|ever|lang=nl|title=}} + {{proto|Germanic|wiht-|thing|lang=nl|title}}.

It was originally a pronoun meaning "not a thing", and was later used to reinforce a regular negation. The pronomial meaning was lost in Middle Dutch. English {{term|not|lang=en}}, and its older forms {{term|naught|lang=en}} and {{term|nought|lang=en}}, were formed in the same way, but "not" also lost its sense as a pronoun and became a negation adverb as in Dutch.
