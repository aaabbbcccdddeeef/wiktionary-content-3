{{see|non}}
==English==

===Etymology 1===
From {{L.}} ''[[non]]'', [[w:Old Latin|Old Latin]] ''[[noenu]]'', ''[[noenum]]'', from ''[[neoenum]]'', "not one". See [[none]].

====Prefix====
'''non-'''

# A prefix used in the sense of [[not]] to negate the meaning of the word to which it is attached, as in [[nonattention]] (or [[non-attention]]), [[nonconformity]], [[nonmetallic]] and [[nonsuit]].

=====Translations=====
*Finnish: [[ei-]], [[ep√§-]]

====Usage notes====
* The prefix '''non-''' may be joined to a word by means of a hyphen, which is standard in British usage.  In many cases, especially in American usage, '''non''' is joined without a hyphen, but a hyphen is preferred if its absence would obscure the understanding or pronunciation of the word.  Some '''non-''' words rarely or never use a hyphen (such as '''nonentity''').
* '''[[Non]]''' meaning ''not'' in phrases taken from Latin and some other languages, '''non''' is a separate word and is not hyphenated.  Examples: [[non compos mentis]], [[persona non grata]].
* As '''non-''' is a living prefix, the list of words having the prefix '''non-''' is practically unlimited.
* '''Non-''' may be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs to negate their meaning.
