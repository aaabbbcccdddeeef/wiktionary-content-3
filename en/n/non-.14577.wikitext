{{also|non|nón}}
==English==

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|la}} {{term|non|lang=la}}, from {{etyl|OL.}} {{term|noenu|lang=la}}, {{term|noenum|lang=la}}, from {{term|neoenum||not one|lang=la}}. See {{term|none|lang=en}}.

====Pronunciation====
* {{IPA|/ˈnɒn/}}

====Prefix====
{{en-prefix}}

# {{non-gloss definition|Used in the sense of {{term|not|lang=en}}, to negate the meaning of the word to which it is prefixed.}}

=====Usage notes=====
* The prefix {{term||non-}} may be joined to a word by means of a hyphen, which is standard in British usage. In many cases, especially in American usage, {{term||non-}} is joined without a hyphen.  (For example, {{term|nonbaseball}} is relatively common, but {{term|noncricket}} &mdash; referring to a primarily British sport &mdash; is rare.) Some {{term||non-}} words rarely or never use a hyphen (such as {{term|nonentity}}).
* Unlike {{term|un-}}, {{term||non-}} tends to suggest an absolute negation without the possibility of shades of comparison.  For example, {{term||more [[unkind]]}} sounds quite natural, but {{term||more [[nonhelpful]]}} does not.
* Meaning "not" in phrases taken from Latin and some other languages, {{term|non}} is a separate word and is not hyphenated.  Examples: [[non compos mentis]], [[persona non grata]].
* As {{term||non-}} is a living prefix, the list of words having the prefix {{term||non-}} is practically unlimited.  It is particularly common in the sciences.
* {{term||Non-}} may be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs to negate their meaning.
