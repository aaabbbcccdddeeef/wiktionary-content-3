=====Usage notes=====
{{rel-top|Usage notes}}
* The prefix '''non-''' may be joined to a word by means of a hyphen, which is standard in British usage.  In many cases, especially in American usage, '''non''' is joined without a hyphen, but a hyphen is preferred if its absence would obscure the understanding or pronunciation of the word.  (For example, {{term|nonbaseball}} is relatively common, but {{term|noncricket}} &mdash; referring to a primarily British sport &mdash; is rare.)   Some '''non-''' words rarely or never use a hyphen (such as '''nonentity''').
* Unlike '''un-''', '''non-''' tends to suggest an absolute negation without the possibility of shades of comparison.  For example, "more unkind" sounds quite natural, but "more nonhelpful" does not.
* '''[[Non]]''' meaning ''not'' in phrases taken from Latin and some other languages, '''non''' is a separate word and is not hyphenated.  Examples: [[non compos mentis]], [[persona non grata]].
* As '''non-''' is a living prefix, the list of words having the prefix '''non-''' is practically unlimited.  It is particularly common in the sciences.
* '''Non-''' may be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs to negate their meaning.
