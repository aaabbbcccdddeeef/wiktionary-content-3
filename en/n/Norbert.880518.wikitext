#* '''2009''' Jeff Carlisle, ''Soccer's Most Wanted II'', Potomac Books, Inc., ISBN 1597971936, page 234: 
#*: '''Norbert''' is a moniker one normally doesn't associate with one of the game's most intimidating midfielders, but "Nobby" provided the steel for the England side that prevailed in the 1966 World Cup, and his gap-toothed visage would have earned him a guest spot in the movie ''Halloween''.
