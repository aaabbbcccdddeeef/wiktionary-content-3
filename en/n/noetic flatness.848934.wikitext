'''[[noetic]] [[flatness]]'''

# refers to the notion that 1) two or more elements affect each other equally (e.g., the internet and society equally affect each other), or 2) one element possesses two opposite characteristics in equal strength (e.g., the internet is equally democratic and anti-democratic). Noetic flatness, along with other traits of extreme [[postmodernism]], is criticized in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomeritis Boomeritis], the book by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber Ken Wilber]. The problem with noetic flatness as an analytical tool is that it 1) lacks consideration of power and dynamism, eliminating the need for a distinction between the two or more elements at hand (why distinguish between the internet and society if they affect each other equally; are they therefore not one and the same?), and 2) says nothing of the element vis-à-vis the characteristic of interest (claiming that the internet is equally democratic and anti-democratic teaches nothing about the internet vis-à-vis democratization).
