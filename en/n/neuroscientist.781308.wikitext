|passage=Most '''neuroscientists''' would be very sceptical of claims that consciousness of any sort could exist independently of a living brain. There is a growing consensus that consciousness, like life, weather, and cricket, is just another part of the natural world â€“ albeit one that is reluctant to divulge its secrets. But it is unwise to dismiss reports of near-death experiences, which are usually reported after traumatic life-threatening events such as heart attacks.}}
