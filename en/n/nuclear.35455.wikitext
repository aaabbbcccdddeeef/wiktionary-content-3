''' Pronunciation Controversy'''

The last pronunciation is the subject of controversy; however, [m-w.com] recognizes it citing usage by influential figures (such as George W. Bush) and educated professionals.  Clearly, it is not a pronunciation consistent with the word's etymology, as nuclear is derived from the word ''nucleus'' about which there is no debate regarding pronunciation.  It is therefore logical to conclude that the latter pronunciation came about through common usage in culture as a variation on the original pronunciation dictated by etymology.  

It has been conjectured that the reason for the nu-ky&-l&r variation to be so common is that the English language contains no other vowel clusters pronounced like the ea in nuklɛɚ, whereas the words "particular" and "spectacular", for example, are examples of the fairly common pronounciation of the "cular" syllables found in the latter pronunciation for nuclear.
