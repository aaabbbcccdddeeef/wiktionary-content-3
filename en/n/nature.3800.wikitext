# {{lb|en|uncountable|often|_|capitalized}} The [[way]] [[things]] [[are]], the [[totality]] of [[all]] [[thing]]s in the [[physical]] [[universe]] and [[their]] [[order]], [[especially]] the [[physical]] [[world]] [[in contrast]] to [[spiritual]] [[realm]]s and [[flora]] and [[fauna]] as [[distinct]] from [[human]] [[convention]]s, [[art]], and [[technology]].
#* {{RQ:Milton Paradise Lost|book=8|passage=I oft admire<br>How '''Nature''', wise and frugal, could commit<br>Such disproportions.}}
#* '''1808''', {{w|Dugald Stewart}}, ''Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind'', [https://archive.org/details/b29319663/page/314/mode/2up?q=train pp. 315–6]:
#*: In the works of '''nature''' we find, in many instances, beauty and sublimity involved among circumstances, which are either indifferent, or which obstruct the general effect: and it is only by a train of experiments, that we can separate those circumstances from the rest... Accordingly, the inexperienced artist, when he copies '''nature''', will copy her servilely... and the beauties of his performances will be encumbered with a number of superfluous or disagreeable concomitants. Experience and observation alone can enable him to make this determination: to exhibit the principles of beauty pure and unadulterated, and to form a creation of his own, more faultless, than ever fell under the observation of his senses.
#* '''1816''', {{w|Matthew Jouett|Matthew Harris Jouett}}, ''Notes... on Painting with {{w|Gilbert Stuart|Gilbert Stuart Esqr}}'':
#*: Most persons in striving after effect lose the likeness when they should go together to produce a good effect you must copy '''Nature''': leave '''Nature''' for an imaginary effect & you lose all. '''Nature''' as '''Nature''' cannot be exceeded, and as your object it [is] to copy '''Nature''' [[twere]] the [[height|hight]] of folly to look at any thing else to produce that copy.
#* {{RQ:Macaulay History of England|chapter=6|passage='''Nature''' has caprices which art cannot imitate.}}
#* {{RQ:Hawthorne Scarlet Letter|page=[https://archive.org/details/scarletletterrom01hawt/page/186/mode/2up 186–7]|text=Nothing was more common, in those days, than to interpret all meteoric appearances, and other natural phenomena, that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon, as so many revelations from a supernatural source... But what shall we say, when an individual discovers a revelation, addressed to himself alone, on the same vast sheet of record! In such a case, it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state, when a man, rendered morbidly self-contemplative by long, intense, and secret pain, had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of '''nature''', until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his soul's history and fate.}}
#* '''1891''', {{w|Oscar Wilde}}, ''{{w|The Decay of Lying}}''
#*: '''Nature''' has good intentions, of course, but, as {{w|Aristotle}} once said, she cannot carry them out. When I look at a landscape I cannot help seeing all its defects.

#*: ...they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a case of twice two makes four! '''Nature''' does not ask your permission, she has nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or dislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently all her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall... Merciful Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of '''nature''' and arithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four? Of course I cannot break through the wall by battering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock it down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is a stone wall and I have not the strength.
#* '''1928''', Christopher Dawson, ''The Age of the Gods'', p. 49:
#*: Man was entirely at the mercy of '''nature'''—a mere scavenger who eked out a miserable existence as a food-gatherer and an eater of shell-fish.

====Usage notes====
In its primary sense as the material world, its inhabitants, and their order, ''nature'' is frequently [[personify|personified]] in English conversation and literature, primarily as a cold and indifferent entity or as a wise and loving nurturer (see {{m|en|Mother Nature}}). In its sense as the essential characteristics of humanity, man's present ''nature'' is usually taken in Christian thought as debased by {{l|en|original sin}} or inherent frailty but amenable to purification through {{l|en|grace}}; English consideration of {{l|en|human nature}} frequently continues to maintain a similar focus on resigned acceptance of its failings and distinctions between better/higher and worse/lower ''natures''.
