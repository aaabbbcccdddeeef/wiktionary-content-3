In colloquial usage in [[English language|English]] since 1612, adopted in other Western languages, '''Nabob''' is a corrupted form of the Indian title [[Nawab]], common because it was homophonous with the Bengali pronunciation. It was originally used in error to refer to Nawabs, but since at least 1764, acquired a specific meaning: commoners: a [[merchant]]-leader, of high [[social status]] and [[wealth]]. Often, in England, the term was applied to those recently returned from the colonies. Men from the [[East India Company]] frequently made vast fortunes; and resentment tended to build up against Company men returning to purchase estates traditionally the preserve of the established aristocracy. 

The word was sometimes mispronounced or misspelled '''"nob"''' or '''"knob"''': this gave rise both to the name of an [[Nob Hill|exclusive district]] of [[San Francisco]] populated by nabobs suddenly rich in the [[Gold Rush]] and, in the British Isles, to an insult.

It can also be used metaphorically for people who have a grandiose style or manner (including of speech) as in [[Spiro Agnew]]'s famous dismissal of the press as "''nattering nabobs of negativism''".
