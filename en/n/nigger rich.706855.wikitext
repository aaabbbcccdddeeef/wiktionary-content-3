"Well, ‘'''Nigger rich'''’ is an expression in America, especially the southeast, which loosely translated means: When a man who has an abundance of money, who has never had that much money, he usually goes out and spends it foolishly. It was attributed to blacks in America, because often, when they acquire a windfall of money, they seem to go out and purchase big cars, usually a Cadillac."
