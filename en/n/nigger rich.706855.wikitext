==English==
''Nigger Rich'' is an derogatory term equivalent to that of the legitimate expression of Nouveau riche. As implied by the expression, Nigger Rich is the state of someone who is either not wealthy, does not have "class", or has recently earned her (usually his) money spending one's money extravagantly. The supposed irony is that this person does not have or "should not" have this money is spending all of one's money away, usually in a tasteless fashion. The expression implies that money should be spent in a specific way by a specific race. Other than being used to literally denigrate blacks, it is used to insult other non-White Anglo-Saxon Protestant people as well. The expression can as easily be used to insult Italians, Hispanics, and White Trash. To make this expression even more offensive towards blacks, it is supposed to be insulting to have one's spending habits compared to that of a black person.
