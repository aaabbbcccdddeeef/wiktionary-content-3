===Etymology===
Origin uncertain: perhaps an alteration of {{term|newie}} with intrusive {{term||B}} (compare {{term|freebie}}), perhaps a shortening of {{term|new boy}} or {{term|new}} {{term|beginner}}. Very likely originated in Newfoundland, where the term 'new boy' is quite common, and sounds like 'newbie' when spoken.
