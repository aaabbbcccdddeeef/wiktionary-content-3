===Etymology===
From Latin ''[[niger]]'', "[[black]]".

Most of the romance languages ([[Italian]], [[Spanish]], [[Portuguese]]...) have the word "negro" meaning "black" (in colour) derived from the Latin "niger". During the period in America's history when black workers were shipped to southern America to work on plantations, this word came to be adopted from the hispanic South American languages to describe a person of dark skin. Essentially, a "negro" person simply means a "black" person. Through constant repition of the Spanish word in the southern [[American]] [[accent]], it seems likely that the word was corrupted from "negro" to "niggero" to simply "nigger". The term "nigger" has taken on perjorative qualities as it implies not only darkness of skin, but a general lack of intelligence and sophistication. At the time of the word's origin, various English speaking North American settlers who set cultural standards considered black people fundementally inferior and less civilised. The term is generally considered offensive to black people not only because it singles them out on the basis of their skin colour, but also, because of its origin, it carries connotations of slavery, inferiority and oppression.

===Pronunciation===
*nĭg'ə(r), /ˈnɪɡə(r)/, /"nIg@(r)/

===Usage Note===
Although this word comes from the Latin word ''[[niger]]'', which simply means '''black''', the use of this word to refer to a black or a person of [[African]] descent is normally considered pejorative (most often extremely, highly, or strongly so).  The word is, however, used by some black people as a neutral or even affirmative term when used in the form of "nigga".

When used by someone who is not black, ''nigger'' is almost invariably considered offensive.  In its pejorative sense, it arguably ranks as the most offensive and insulting racial/ethnic term in English, carrying with it strong connotations of cultural, aesthetic, and intellectual inferiority or deficiency (such connotations of deficiency extending to a perception of exoticism).  Indeed, the term ''can'' be callously cruel: with its most conceivably creatively pejorative uses (e.g., if a non-black were to hurl the term at a random black in a wincing and forceful way), the term can be loaded with meanings that all exude a perception of a highly deficient and exotic [[thinghood]] at its target, as unfair and false as the perceptions may be.

Changing attitudes and realizations towards those of black origin (e.g., realizing that blacks are not intellectually, or in other ways, inferior to other races; acknowledgement of highly significant cultural contributions made by blacks; civil rights advances made by blacks) has made the writing of this word taboo in many instances, or if it is written, it is often [[obfuscate|obfuscated]] as "N_____", "N****r", etc.
