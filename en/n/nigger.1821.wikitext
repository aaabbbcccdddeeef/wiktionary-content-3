===Etymology===
From Latin ''[[niger]]'', "[[black]]".

Most of the romance languages ([[Italian]], [[Spanish]], [[Portuguese]]...) have the word "negro" meaning "black" (in colour) derived from the Latin "niger". During the period in America's history when black workers were shipped to America to work as slaves, this word came to be adopted from the Hispanic South American languages to describe a person of dark skin. Essentially, a "negro" person simply means a "black" person. Through constant repetition of the Spanish word in the  [[American]] [[accent]], it seems likely that the word was corrupted from "negro" to "niggero" to simply "nigger". The term "nigger" has taken on pejorative qualities as it implies not only darkness of skin, but a general lack of intelligence and sophistication. At the time of the word's origin, various English speaking North American settlers who set cultural standards considered black people fundamentally inferior and less civilized. The term is generally considered offensive to black people not only because it singles them out on the basis of their skin colour, but also, because of its origin, it carries connotations of slavery, inferiority and oppression.

===Usage notes===
Usage of this word to refer to blacks or people of [[African]] descent is usually considered pejorative (most often extremely, highly, or strongly so).  The word is, however, used by some black people as a neutral or even affirmative term when used in the form of "nigga".
Usage by non-blacks, ''nigger'' is almost invariably considered offensive.  

In its pejorative sense, it arguably ranks as the most insulting racial epithet in the English language, with strong connotations of cultural and intellectual inferiority or deficiency. The controversial nature of the word makes it unacceptable for use in most modern mainstream American media. The word is usually censored in direct quotations or euphemistically referred to as the "N-word" to blunt its potential negative impact.
