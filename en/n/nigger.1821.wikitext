====Usage notes====
* The word "nigger" is one of the most offensive taboo words in the English language, especially in the United States. In a study by Kristy Beers Fägersten, Americans rated ''nigger'' the most offensive word in English, more offensive than<!--this is mentioned specifically to convey that the two words were compared and "n" was more offensive in the US, opposite to the situation in the UK and NZ--> ''[[cunt]]''.<ref>Kristy Beers Fägersten ''A sociolinguistic analysis of swear word offensiveness'' (2007)</ref> A study by New Zealand's {{w|Broadcasting Standards Authority}} found that ''nigger'' was the second-most offensive word in New Zealand (after ''[[cunt]]''), offending 66% of people,<ref>[http://bsa.govt.nz/images/assets/Research/What-Not-to-Swear-Full-BSA2010.pdf What Not to Swear]</ref> and a similar study by several British broadcasting organizations found that "nigger" offended 68% of Brits and was the fifth most offensive word in the UK (after ''[[cunt]]'', ''[[motherfucker]]'', ''[[fuck]]'', and ''[[wanker]]'').<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/uploads/Delete_Expletives.pdf "Delete expletives?"]</ref>
* There have been efforts by those of African descent to reclaim the word (especially in the form ''[[nigga]]''), but these efforts are controversial, and some people<!--add a ref here--> do not believe it is able to be reclaimed, due to its fraught history and continued derogatory usage. Usage by non-blacks is almost invariably highly offensive.
* "Nigger" has derogatory connotations, suggesting not only negatively-perceived darkness of skin, but general lack of intelligence; it is furthermore associated with the era of white colonization of Africa and enslavement of Africans and African Americans.
* To blunt its force, the word is frequently censored in direct quotations or euphemistically referred to as the "[[n-word]]".
