====Usage notes====
* The word "nigger" is considered one of the most racist and offensive words in the English language. In a 2007 study by Kristy Beers Fägersten, undergraduates at the University of Florida were asked to rate 12 [[pejorative]] English words on a scale of 1 ('Not Offensive') to 10 ('Very Offensive'). Participants rated ''nigger'' the most offensive, nearly 2 points higher than the second-most offensive word, <!--this is mentioned specifically to convey that the two words were compared and "n" was more offensive in the US, opposite to the situation in the UK and NZ--> ''[[cunt]]''.<ref>{{cite-journal|author=Kristy Beers Fägersten|title=A sociolinguistic analysis of swear word offensiveness|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-sociolinguistic-analysis-of-swear-word-Fägersten/36d7919d6bacad334afa455b01e9b2877efb9dc7|journal=Saarland Working Papers in Linguistics (SWPL)|location=Högskolan Dalarna (Dalarna University), Sweden|date=2007|pages=14-37}}</ref> New Zealand's {{w|Broadcasting Standards Authority}} conducted a study in 2010 and again in 2013 which found that ''nigger'' was the second-most offensive word in New Zealand (after ''[[cunt]]''), offending 66% and 65% of those surveyed respectively,<ref>[http://bsa.govt.nz/images/assets/Research/What-Not-to-Swear-Full-BSA2010.pdf ''What Not to Swear: The Acceptability of Words in Broadcasting'']</ref><ref>[https://www.bsa.govt.nz/oldsite/assets/Research/Acceptability_of_Words_2013_WEB.pdf ''What Not to Swear: The Acceptability of Words in Broadcasting, 2013'']</ref> and a similar study by several British broadcasting organizations found that "nigger" offended 68% of Brits and was the fifth most offensive word in the UK (after ''[[cunt]]'', ''[[motherfucker]]'', ''[[fuck]]'', and ''[[wanker]]'').<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/uploads/Delete_Expletives.pdf "Delete expletives?"]</ref>
* There have been efforts by those of African descent to reclaim the word (especially in the form ''[[nigga]]''), but these efforts are controversial and some people do not believe it is able to be reclaimed due to its fraught history and continued derogatory usage.<ref>{{cite-journal|author=Rachel Higson|title=Considering the N-Word: To Reject or Reclaim?|url=https://www.prindlepost.org/2017/09/considering-n-word-reject-reclaim/|journal=The Prindle Post|location=DePauw, Indiana|publisher=The Janet Prindle Institute for Ethics at DePauw University|date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> Regardless, usage by non-blacks is still almost invariably considered highly racist and offensive.
* "Nigger" has derogatory connotations, suggesting not only white racism and negatively-perceived darkness of skin but also unfavorable attributes such as a lack of intelligence, chronic unemployment, use of government welfare, a propensity toward drug use and criminal behavior, etc.<ref>{{pedia|Stereotypes of African Americans}}</ref> It is furthermore associated with the era of white colonization of Africa and enslavement of Africans and African Americans.
* To blunt its force, the word is commonly referred to as the "[[n-word]]" and may be censored in direct quotations.
* Not to be confused with the similar-sounding {{m|en|niggard|t=miser}}.
