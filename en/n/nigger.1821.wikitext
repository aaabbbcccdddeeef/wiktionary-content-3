===Etymology===
Ultimately from the {{etyl|la|en}} adjective ''[[niger]]'', meaning "[[black]]". Several Romance languages ([[Italian]], [[Spanish]], [[Portuguese]], etc) have the word "[[negro]]" meaning "black" (in colour) derived from the Latin "niger", while French has {{term|noir}}, its [[nègre]] being borrowed from Spanish. During the period in America's history when black workers were shipped to America to work as slaves, this word came to be adopted from the Hispanic South American languages to describe a person of dark skin. Essentially, a "negro" person simply means a "black" person. Through constant repetition of the Spanish word in the [[American]] [[accent]], it seems likely that the word was corrupted from "negro" to "niggero" to simply "nigger".

====Usage notes====
Today the word "nigger" is potentially extremely offensive and, particularly in the United States, politically inflammatory. Although it has to some extent been reclaimed by some persons of African descent, its use remains controversial, particularly when used by non-blacks.

"Nigger" has taken on pejorative qualities, as it implies not only darkness of skin, but a general lack of intelligence and sophistication. At the time of the word's origin, various English-speaking North American settlers who set cultural standards considered black people fundamentally inferior and less civilized than white people. The term is generally considered offensive to black people, not only because it singles them out on the basis of their skin colour, but also because, due to its origin, it carries connotations of slavery, inferiority and oppression.

The term is generally derogatory ([[racist]]) when used by persons not of African descent (and sometimes when used by persons of African descent), but, it is also used by some black people among themselves, positively, especially when used in the form of "[[nigga]]," in a form of [[reclamation]]. It is important to note that many people do not believe that "nigger" is able to be reclaimed, because of its fraught history and continued pejorative usage. Usage by non-blacks, however, is almost invariably considered offensive.

In its pejorative sense, it ranks among the most insulting racial epithets in the English language, with strong connotations of cultural and intellectual inferiority or deficiency. The controversial nature of the word makes it unacceptable for use in most modern [[mainstream American]] media. The word is usually censored in direct quotations or euphemistically referred to as the "[[n-word]]" to blunt its potential negative impact.
