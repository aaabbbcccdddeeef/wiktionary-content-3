===Adjective===
{{en-adj}}

# Having the dark blue colour of [[navy blue]].
#* '''2006''', Samantha Hunt, ''The Seas: A Novel'', page 57:

#* '''1943''', Fletcher Pratt, ''The Navy has wings'', page 167: 
#*: [...] there are chess ships and checker ships and those where acey-deucey is almost the only game, the sailors' own improved version of backgammon. Fliers from the seacoast of Iowa, anxious to be as '''navy''' as the rest, are usually the first to pick it up.
#* '''1993''', Robert A. Frezza, ''McLendon's Syndrome'', page 299:
#*: Lieutenant Lindquist is '''navy''' through and through. I know she doesn't want to get out. Now, I know there's no way you can assign her to a navy ship, but there has to be something the navy can give her to keep her in space.
#* '''1994''', Harry Carey, ''Company of heroes: my life as an actor in the John Ford stock company'', page 76:

#* '''2003''', Edwin Palmer Hoyt, Thomas H Moorer, ''The Men of the Gambier Bay: The Amazing True Story'', page 21:
#*: Goodwin was '''navy''' through and through.
