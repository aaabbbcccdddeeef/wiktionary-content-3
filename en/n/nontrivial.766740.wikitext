Nontrivial can mean a number of things.
It is a term common among communities of engineers and mathematicians, to indicate a statement or theorem that is not obvious or easy to solve.
It is also used as an understated way of expressing the emotion that a given problem is difficult or convoluted. Sometimes written "non-trivial" in this informal sense.
The term has formal meaning in certain contexts. In mathematics: 
A functional dependency  is called nontrivial if Y is not a subset of X.
A nontrivial factor of a number N is any factor besides 1 and N.
