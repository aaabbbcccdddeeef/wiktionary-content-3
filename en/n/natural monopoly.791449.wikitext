  
Natural Monopoly: This occurs when a firm gains large benefit from Economies of Scale, or Value of Time comparative advantage over it's competitors. This is to say that the Natural Monopoly can, by virtue of size or technological head start, produce a very large percentage of the total market demand for a given product; thereby excluding meaningful competition via price structures.
