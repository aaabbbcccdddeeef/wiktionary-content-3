===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[neutron]] [[star]]}}

# {{star}}: A star that has been so collapsed by [[gravity]] that it does not have [[electron]]s or [[proton|protons]], since they have been merged into neutrons by the intense [[pressure]].  As a result, it is a solid mass of neutrons that is only held apart by the natural strength of the neutrons.  If the mass is sufficient, the neutron star collapses into a [[black hole]] and becomes a point of [[infinitely]] dense matter.  The material of a neutron star is sometimes called [[neutronium]], since it lacks anything save neutrons.
