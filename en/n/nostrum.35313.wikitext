{{en-noun|pl2=nostra}}

# A [[medicine]] or [[remedy]] in [[conventional]] use which has not been [[proven]] to have any [[desirable]] [[medical]] [[effect]]s.
#* {{RQ:Fielding Tom Jones|V|ii}}
#*: Nay, he would sometimes retire hither to take his beer, and it was not without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer too: for no quack ever held his '''nostrum''' to be a more general panacea than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in all the physic in an apothecary's shop.
#* '''1890''', [[w:Arthur Conan Doyle|Arthur Conan Doyle]], ''[[w:The Sign of the Four|The Sign of the Four]]''
#*: I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack '''nostrums''', some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket.
# An [[ineffective]] but [[favorite]] [[remedy]] for a problem, usually involving [[political]] action.
#* '''2011''', Sean Corrigan, ''[http://www.zerohedge.com/news/wasteland-how-central-planning-broke-all-markets-and-what-we-can-do-fix-them The Wasteland]'':
#*: With the glaring failure to predict even the possibility - much less circumstance - of the recent Crash and with the even more foreseeable failure of its tired old, rehashed '''nostrums''' of ending the slump by means of an inequitable programme of corporate welfare, inflationary "unorthodoxy", and the unleashing of the debt-spewing monster of the state to gorge itself upon such things as individuals and private concerns no longer care to consumer, it should hardly be controversial to asset that mainstream macroeconomics - and the reputations of the many panderers to power who practice it - are equally broken.
