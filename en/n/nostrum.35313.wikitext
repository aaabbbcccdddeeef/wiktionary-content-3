#* {{RQ:Fielding Tom Jones|book=V|chapter=II|passage=Nay, he would sometimes retire hither to take his beer, and it was not without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer too: for no quack ever held his '''nostrum''' to be a more general panacea than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in all the physic in an apothecary's shop.}}

#*: I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack '''nostrums''', some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket.

Pterostilbene, a compound derived from the fruit, shows promise as a compound to lower cholesterol with few side effects, Agnes Rimando, of the US Department of Agriculture natural products team in Oxford, Mississippi, told the American Chemical Society.}}

#* '''2009''', A.C. Grayling, ''Ideas That Matter: A Personal Guide for the 21st Century'':
#*: Neocons have far more interest in foreign policy than domestic policy. As regards the latter the reflex '''nostrums''' of right-wing attitudes apply: less tax, less government, libertarianism about matters such as gun control, encouragement of individual responsibility in health care and education, 'faith-based solutions' to social and welfare problems, and so forth.
#* '''2011''', Sean Corrigan, ''[http://www.zerohedge.com/news/wasteland-how-central-planning-broke-all-markets-and-what-we-can-do-fix-them The Wasteland]'':
