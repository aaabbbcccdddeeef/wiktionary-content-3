{{also|Nick}}

==English==
{{wikipedia}}

===Etymology===
From a variation of {{m|en|nock}}. Compare German {{m|de|Knick||a flaw, defect}}; German {{m|de|knicken||to crack}}. 
Also partly from {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|nicken}}, {{m|enm|nikken||to nod; wink}}, an intensive form of {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|hnīgan||to bend, bow down, incline, descend, decline, sink}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*hnīganą}}, {{m|gem-pro|*hnīwaną||to bow, tilt, slant, slope, incline}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*kneygʷʰ-||to bend, bow}}, from {{m|ine-pro|*ken-||to press, pinch, kink}}. Cognate with Old Frisian {{m|ofs|hnekka||to nod}}, Dutch {{m|nl|nikken||to nod}}, German {{m|de|nicken||to nod; kink}}, Danish {{m|da|nikke||to nod}}, Swedish {{m|sv|nicka||to nod}}. 
The sense "point in time", "point marked" is from a conflation of the "notch" and the "wink" (i.e. "moment") senses.
