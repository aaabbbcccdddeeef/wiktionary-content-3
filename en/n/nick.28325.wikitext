===Etymology 1===
The noun is derived from Late {{inh|en|enm|nik||notch, tally; nock of an arrow}}.<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=nik|part of speech=n|id=MED29531|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> Its {{unknown|en|title=further etymology is unknown}}; a connection with {{m|en|nock||notch in a bow to hold the bowstring; notch at the rear of an arrow that fits the bowstring; cleft in the buttocks}} has not been clearly established.<ref>{{R:OED Online|part of speech=''n.{{sup|1}}''|noformat=yes|id=126760|date=September 2003|nodot=yes}}; {{R:Oxford Dictionaries Online}}</ref>

The verb appears to be derived from the noun, though the available evidence shows that some of the verb senses predate the noun senses. No connection with words in {{w|Germanic languages}} such as {{cog|da|nikke||to nod}}, {{cog|dum|nicken||to bend; to bow}} (modern {{cog|nl|nikken||to nod}}), {{cog|gml|nicken||to bend over; to sink}}, {{cog|gmh|nicken||to bend; to depress}} (modern {{cog|de|nicken||to nod}}), {{cog|gml|knicken||to bend; to snap}} (modern {{cog|de|knicken||to bend; to break}}, {{cog|ofs|hnekka||to nod}}, and {{cog|sv|nicka||to nod}}, has been clearly established.<ref>{{R:OED Online|part of speech=''v.{{sup|2}}''|noformat=yes|id=126763|date=September 2003}}</ref>
