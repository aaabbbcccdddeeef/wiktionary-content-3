(also spelt naf), the fan, the vagina. ([[backslang]]). Used by prostitutes from the 14th century, according to Eric Partridge Dictionary of Slang. 

===Adjective===

'''Naff'''
(''[[comparative]]'' '''naffer''', ''[[superlative]]'' '''naffest''')



#Awful, hopeless (also spelt naph). Originally [[Polari]]
#''N''ot ''A''vailible ''F''or ''F''ucking. An unavailable guy. This is probably an attempt to etymologise the first version.

===Etymology===

The meaning of naff being hopeless is the subject to much debate, but it seems logical that it comes from the noun meaning (as suggested by Collins). Polari could well have been spoken by prostituites. The alternative spelling of naph is probably a red herring. It is unlikely to come from Not Available For Fucking as it is unlikely to held different meanings by the same group of people at the same time.
