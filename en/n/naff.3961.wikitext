{{also|Naff}}
==English==

===Etymology===
{{rfc|This etymology needs lots of references}}
Of uncertain origin.
* Collins suggests a possible 19th century origin from [[back slang]] of ''fan'', [[fanny]].
* The American Heritage Dictionary suggests a possible dialectal origin but goes no further.
* Wiktionary contributors suggest it is derived from the [[Polari]] word ''[[naph]]'', and <!--no doubt was -->popularised and hence changed its spelling due to being used on the BBC radio programme <i>Round the Horne</i> by Julian and Sandy in the 1960s.
* The Oxford English Dictionary has no evidence before 1966 and mentions the Polari theory and others without going so far as to accept any of them without further evidence.
* Cassell's Dictionary of Slang refers to it being confused. Its etymology is confused with '''N'''ot '''A'''vailable '''F'''or '''F'''ucking in gay speak (not Polari), an unavailable man. However it is unlikely the word held both these meanings at once by the same group of people. See [http://books.google.com/books?id=5GpLcC4a5fAC&pg=PA986&dq=naph+polari&lr=lang_en&as_brr=0&ei=bDSTSNb0ApzOswP7p-D7DA&sig=ACfU3U0vYA2AjjAA27jWyPA5OIHthNsF2A ''Cassel's Dictionary of Slang'' entry]
* The BBC show Balderdash and Piffle disagrees with Cassell's.
* ''1811 Lexicon Balatronicum'' lists "NIFFYNAFFY FELLOW" as "a trifler."
* 1755 ''A Dictionary of the English Language'' Samuel Johnson defines "naff" as "A tufted seabird."
