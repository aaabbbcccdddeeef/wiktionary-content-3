*Collins suggests a possible 19th century origin from [[back slang]] of ''fan'', [[fanny]].
*AHD suggests a possible dialectal origin but goes no further.
*Wiktionary contributors suggest it is derived from the [[Polari]] word ''[[naph]]'', and <!--no doubt was -->popularised and hence changed its spelling due to being used on the BBC radio programme <i>Round the Horne</i> by Julian and Sandy in the 1960s.
*OED and Encarta merely state the etymology is unknown.
*Merriam-Webster and Etymology Online offer no information.
