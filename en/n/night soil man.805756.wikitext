A '''night soil man''' was a person whose occupation it was to collect the contents of [[chamber pot]]s ([[feces|faeces]]) in the morning from domestic households, principally in the [[18th Century|Eighteenth]] and [[19th Century|Nineteenth Centuries]]. They also went by the title ''nightman'', and often doubled as [[chimney sweep]]s.

The role of nightman diminished with the rise in popularity of the [[flush toilet]] and [[Sewer|sewage systems]].
