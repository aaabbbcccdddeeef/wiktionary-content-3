===Usage notes===
For a word to no longer be considered new, it needs to be understood by a significant portion of the population, as having always been a valid word.  For that to occur, the word must have been in common use for approximately one generation; fifteen to twenty years.  No exact measure of how long a word needs to be part of the language to no longer be considered "new" is universally accepted.
