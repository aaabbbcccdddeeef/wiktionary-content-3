# A supporter of [[veganism]]
# A person who does not consume, use or eat any animal products.
<!-- There has been a kind of tug-of-war about the definitions vegan and vegetarian. According to other dictionaries the term "vegetarian" is a generic term covering many kinds of people that avoid animal products in their diet, including vegans, lactovegetarians, pescetarians etc. The definition below is written from that starting point. Before rushing to rewriting the article once again, please check at least three other dictionaries. EXAMPLE ENTRIES IN WIKTIONARY #:'''1897 Hunter, Robert, and Charles Morris''', ''Universal Dictionary of the English Language'', Vol 4, p5045:
#:*'''Vegetarian Society''' [...] A society [...] formed at Manchester in 1847, to promote the use of cereals, pulse, and fruit, as articles of diet; and to induce habits of abstinence from fish, flesh, and fowl, as food.
#:'''1897 Hunter, Robert, and Charles Morris''', ''Universal Dictionary of the English Language'', Vol 4, p5045:
#:*'''vegetarian''' [...] One who abstains from animal food, living exclusively on vegetables, milk, eggs, and the like. The more strict vegetarians eat vegetables and farinaceous food only, abstaining from eggs, butter, and milk.-->
