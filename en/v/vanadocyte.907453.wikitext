# The [[blood cell]] of [[sea squirt]]s, containing [[hemovanadin]] rather than [[hemoglobin]].
#* {{quote-journal|lang=en|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|year=1939|author=DA Webb|passage=Henze (1913 a) was able to localize the vanadium chromogen in certain blood cells which he designated as morulae (''Maulbeerformen''). {{...}}  This type of cell, which, as will be shown later, is probably confined to the Ascidiidae and Perophoridae, is hereinafter referred to as a "'''vanadocyte'''", in order to distinguish it from other types of morulae which do not possess the properties just described.|volume=16|page=499}}
#* {{quote-book|lang=en|title=Marine Natural Products V3: Chemical And Biological Perspectives|author=Poul Schever|year=2012|passage=Such a solution would be expected to be an extremely complex mixture of molecules with possibility of artifact formation between '''vanadocyte''' vanadium and ligands originating from other cell types.}}
#* {{quote-book|lang=en|title=A Secret World: Natural Products of Marine Life|page=165|author=F. Pietra|year=2013|passage=Vanadium can be stored in such an unusual form because of a reducing and complexing bright yellow pigment called tunichrome-B1, which is found in active blood cells called '''vanadocytes'''.}}
