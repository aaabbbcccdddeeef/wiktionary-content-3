==English==

===Etymology===
Originating from an inaccurate interpretation of verses attributed to {{w|Julius Caesar}}: ''“Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adiuncta foret vis, Comica ut aequato virtus polleret honore Cum Graecis [...]”''. An erroneous interpunction lead to mistaking {{m|la|cōmica}} as tied to {{m|la|vīs}} rather than to {{m|la|virtūs}}.

===Noun===
{{en-noun|-}}

# [[comic|Comic]] [[force]].
#* '''2002''' [http://www.doyletics.com/arj/beesrvw.htm#3fn Bees by Rudolf Steiner, A Review by Bobby Matherne]
#*: Also Steiner tells of someone who claimed that the comic elements comes about when someone has the vis comica, or "power of being comical." Again - the [[dormitive principle]] at work.
