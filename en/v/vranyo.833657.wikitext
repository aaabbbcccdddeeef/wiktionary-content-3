#* {{rfdate}}, Jacques Tocatlian, ''Around the World in 80 Missions'': 
#*: He proceeded to say that '''vranyo''' was untranslatable. [...] When using '''vranyo''', Russians know that they are fibbing and expect their audience to understand that.

|passage=No one could be such an idiot on purpose, you're clearly spreading disinformation in classic, Soviet style. The appropriate term for this is: vranyo.}}
#* '''1994''', John Arundel Barnes, ''A pack of lies: towards a sociology of lying'', page 67:
#*: In Russian culture a distinction is drawn between two kinds of lies, ''vranyo'' and ''lozh'' which do not have exact parallels in English. ''Vranyo'' has been claimed as uniquely Russian, and seems to consist of telling untrue but credible stories, a practice not condemned by those who recognize what is going on. Indeed, for success in ''vranyo''-telling, there must be a listener who pretends to believe in the truth of what is being said. [...] ''Lozh'', on the other hand, implies a conscious intention to deceive.
