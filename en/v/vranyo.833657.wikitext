(singularis tantum)
# Vranyo is a term describing the phenomenon of semi-lie or maybe more precisely "semi-truth with a twist of fantasy, white lies and suppression of (unpleasant) parts of the truth". The term originates from Russian language and is often said to be a common trait of the Russian national character. Its use has evolved over the centuries and especially since the last half of the Soviet era it has become much more sophisticated and institutionalised, e.g. for purposes of state propaganda.
