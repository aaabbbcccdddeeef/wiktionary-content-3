====Usage notes====
Until the 19th century, '''overdo''' was often used [[intransitive]]ly (without a [[direct object]]), but this usage is rare in contemporary English, and has been replaced by the phrase '''''overdo it''''', “to do something too much, in an exaggerated way, or in a way that makes one too tired or endangers one's health:”
: {{ux|en|I think you’ve '''overdone it''' on the food for this evening—there’s enough here to feed an army!}}
: {{ux|en|I wanted to have all the weeding done today, but I '''overdid it''' and now I’m too tired to go out.}}
