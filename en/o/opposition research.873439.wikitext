#{{politics}} A term used to classify and describe efforts of supporters or paid consultants of a political candidate to legally investigate the biographical, legal or criminal, medical, educational, financial and public office or voting records of the opposing candidate,prior news media coverage, usually in the time period between announcement of intent to run and the actual election. Opposition research may also refer to illegal or inethical means of gathering potentially damaging information on candidates, such as accessing credit reports, wiretapping, theft of files, hacking computer files, and interviewing ex-spouses. A third type of opposition research occurs in the 'prebuttal' phase of campaign development, when a candidate's political consultants will amass files of potentially damaging information on their own clients, to prepare pre-emptive strategies for rebuttal at a later date.
