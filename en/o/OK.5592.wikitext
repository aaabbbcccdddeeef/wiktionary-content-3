===Etymology 1===
Abbreviated from "oll korrect", a fanciful spelling of "all correct" as part of a fad for similar comical abbreviations (of which no others have survived) in the US in the late 1830s.
<!--If this is copied from Bill Bryson's book, it is a copyvio and must not appear on the page:

Originated in Boston and New York City around 1839 as part of a slang fad (reminiscent of [[Cockney rhyming slang]] and Russian [[w:padonki|padonki]] slang) where phrases were deliberately misspelt and then reduced to abbreviations. The word '''okay''' was the abbreviation [[OK]] for "oll korrect". [[OK]] is the only term of that era to have become a permanent part of the language.  Others were "O.W." (for "oll write") and "K.Y." (for "know yuse").  The first known use of O.K. in print was on March 23, 1839 in the ''Boston Morning Post''.--><!--Bill Bryson, The Mother Tongue, p. 165 (1990)-->
