Aldebaran is said to be eight hundred and eighty times the mass of the sun, with a diameter of over 8,000,000 miles; a distance so great that a meteor traveling at the rate of thirty miles per second, would require over three days to cross the disk of the star. Yet, notwithstanding the immense volume, the '''accultation''' will occur in a moment, so great is the distance of the star from us, and will continue for about one hour and eight minutes.}}

For example, '''occultations''' by the Uranian rings can define the position of the occulted star relative to the rings to better than 0.02 mas (equivalent to a few hundred meters at the distance of Uranus). '''Occultations''' by atmospheres can be less precise than '''occultations''' by symmerical solid bodies, like rings and large asteroids, with a precision on the order of 1.0 mas.}}

It would be a highlight of the International Year of Astronomy, which reached its peak during 2009.}}
