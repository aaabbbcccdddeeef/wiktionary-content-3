'''Osteoid''' is a [[protein]] [[mixture]] which is secreted by [[osteoblast]]s. When it mineralizes, it becomes [[bone]]. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I [[collagen]].

When there is insufficient mineral or osteoblast dysfunction, the osteoid does not mineralize properly, and it accumulates.  This process is called [[osteomalacia]]. Osteomalacia, when present in children, is defined as [[rickets]].
