====Usage notes====
* Traditionally, the noun {{term||oxymoron}} refers to the figure of speech, wherein the contradiction is deliberate. The use of the term to refer to unintentional contradictions in terms is considered incorrect by some speakers and writers, and is perhaps best avoided in certain contexts. (See the [[w:oxymoron|Wikipedia article]].)
