===Noun===
'''oxymoron''' ''(classical plural:'' '''oxymora''', ''Anglicized plural:'' '''oxymorons''')

# A [[figure of speech]] in which two words of opposing meanings are used together to express two contrasting qualities in one concept.

====Usage note====
{{unreferenced}}
*The standard meaning of '''oxymoron''' is the figure of speech described here, in which the contradiction is deliberate.  In a [[contradiction in terms]], the contradiction is unintentional and the person using the word is often unaware of it.  Use of '''oxymoron''' in the latter sense obscures the standard meaning of the word and so is avoided by careful speakers and writers.
