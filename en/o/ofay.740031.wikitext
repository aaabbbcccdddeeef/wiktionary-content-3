'''Ofay''' is a [[race|racial]] slur; [[slang]] term for a white person.  The term first appeared in print in the early 20th century, and may be older still.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/67/O0036700.html The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.  2000.]</ref>  Its origin is unclear. One logical explanation is the word is Pig Latin for "foe."

At least two possible derivations point to the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and [[Nigeria]].  During the 17th through 19th centuries, European traders established coastal ports in present-day Nigeria for their increasing traffic in slaves destined for the Americas.  Thus, "Ofay" might derive from the [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] word "afia," which means "light-colored," and may have referred to European traders.  

"Ofay" might also come from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word "ofe," spoken in hopes of disappearing from danger such as that posed by European traders.

Another likely source of the word is the French "au fait" (lit. "to the point"), a phrase commonly used in English, and sometimes facetiously used to describe a pompous person.

The word is probably now best known from [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s play "[[A Raisin in the Sun]]", where Beneatha declares insincerely "everything is strictly peachy keen, as the ofay kids say."
