In literal Leet(1337) Language, (OMGWTFBBQ) can be separated into (OMG): Oh Em GEEE, (WTF) WA DA FAKKU, (BBQ) Barbecue.

But when all put together and said in 1337, it would be OMGWTFBBQ ( 0h Em G33 Wut teh fcuk BEe B4e Quee)

The Definition of the 1337 term OMGWTFBBQ is Tacos, which would mean Flea's Hott Sister :D = which would therefore mean IN MY PANTS.

  "Which is epic~win" :]
