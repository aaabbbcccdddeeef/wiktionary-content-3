====Usage notes====
In the field of philosophy there is some variation in how the term "ontology" is used.  "Ontology" is a much more recent term than "[[metaphysics]]" and takes its root meaning explicitly from the Greek term for "being."  "Ontology" can be used loosely as a rough equivalent to "[[metaphysics]]" or more precisely to denote that subset of the domain of metaphysics which is focussed rigorously on the study of being as being.
