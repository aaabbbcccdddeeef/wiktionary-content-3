'''''omni-''''', as a combining form or [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] in [[English language|English]], expresses the idea of "allness". One can generally paraphrase its meaning with circumlocutions such as "in all ways", "in all places" or "applying to all things".

The English prefix exactly matches the form and approximately matches the meaning of the [[Latin]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''omni-'', as in Latin ''omnis'' (all) and ''omnes'' (everyone, all things).

English words in ''omni-'' generally mate the prefix with a Latinate root, for example:
* [[omnipresence|omnipresent]]
* [[omnipotence]]

But ''omni-'' may also combine with non-Latinate elements, as in:
* omniarch
* omnigraph
* [[VHF omnidirectional range|omni-range]]

Most roots with a Germanic linguistic base use the equivalent English prefix ''al[l]-'' (meaning "altogether", "wholly"), as in:
* all-seeing
* all-knowing
* [[almighty]]
* also
* always

Compare the English prefixes of Greek origin: ''[[pan|pan-]]'' ("all", "universal") and ''[[holo-]]'' ("whole", "entire").
