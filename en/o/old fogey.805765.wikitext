'''Old fogey''' is a [[nickname]] used to describe someone as slightly old fashioned: out of touch with modern ideals. 

In [[1811]], an Old Fogey was a nickname for an invalid, wounded soldier; derived from the French word ''fougeux''; fierce or fiery. The modern sense has changed the use a little, but there is still the element of invalid in the saying.

'''''[[Young fogey]]''''' was humorously applied in a [[British]] context to some younger-generation but rather buttoned-down writers and journalists &mdash; examples being [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] and (for a while) [[A. N. Wilson]]. The term is attributed to [[Alan Watkins]] writing in 1984 in ''[[The Spectator]]''.
