{{en-noun}}



#In geology, a spherical grain formed by concentric accretion of thin layers of a mineral around a core. Calcium carbonate (limestone) is the most common mineral that forms ooliths, but they may also form from other minerals such as dolomite and silica. The core around which the mineral accretes may be a small grain of quartz or fecal material from small organisms.
#The term is also used sometimes for oolite, a sedimentary rock composed of ooliths.
