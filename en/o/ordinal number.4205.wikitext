====Usage notes====
On ordinal number usage:
*Ordinal numbers are general construed as ''[[adjective]]s'' followed by {{countable}} [[noun]]s in singular:
*:''eleventh day''
*Ordinal numbers are used for fractions as {{countable}} nouns, and for exponents usually followed by ''power'':
*:''two fifths'', <math>\textstyle\frac{2}{5}</math>
*:''two to the minus twenty-first power'', <math>2^{-21}</math>
*:''six to the third'', <math>6^3</math>
*Ordinal numbers are generally considered to be ordered from ''high'' to ''low''; so that ''first place'' is considered ''highest'', and ''fifth'' is lower than ''second''. ''Degree'' is an exception.
*Ordinal numbers corresponding to numbers higher that 20 use [[cardinal number]]s for all the places preceding the final ordinal part:
*:''twenty-first'' or ''21st'', occasionally ''[[XXI]]''
*:''one hundred fifteenth'' or ''115th'' , occasionally ''CXV''
*:''thirty-three thousandth'' or ''33,000th''
*If an ordinal is followed by a plural noun, the two word phrase refers to a set of items described by the phrase in singular. For example ''second homes'' refers to the a set of ''homes which are considered a "second home."''
*:''Many households have third cars.''
