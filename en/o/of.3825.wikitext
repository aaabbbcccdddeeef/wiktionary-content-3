====Usage notes====
* {{sense|belonging to or associated with}} When applied to a person or persons, the possessive is generally used instead.
* {{sense|containing, comprising{{,}} or made from}} {{term|of|Of}} may be used directly with a verb or adjectival phrase.
* When modifying a noun, modern English uses more and more [[noun adjunct]]s rather than '''''of'''''. Examples include ''[[part of speech]]'' (16th century) vs. ''[[word class]]'' (20th century), ''{{w|Federal Bureau of Investigation}}'' (1908) vs. ''{{w|Central Intelligence Agency}}'' (1947), and ''affairs of the world'' (18th century) vs. ''world affairs'' (20th century).
