=====Usage notes=====
* {{sense|belonging to or associated with}} When applied to a person or persons, the possessive is generally used instead.
* {{sense|containing, comprising{{,}} or made from}} {{m|en||Of}} may be used directly with a verb or adjectival phrase.
* When modifying a noun, modern English increasingly uses [[noun adjunct]]s rather than '''''of'''''. Examples include ''[[part of speech]]'' (16th century) vs. ''[[word class]]'' (20th century), ''{{w|Federal Bureau of Investigation}}'' (1908) vs. ''{{w|Central Intelligence Agency}}'' (1947), and ''affairs of the world'' (18th century) vs. ''world affairs'' (20th century).
* The use of {{m|en|of}} to link nouns to attributive adjectives modified by certain adverbs is always optional; omitting {{m|en|of}} in such instances is always permissible and does not alter the meaning of the expression. Adverbs that may be used with this construction include {{m|en|too}}, {{m|en|so}}, {{m|en|how}}, {{m|en|as}}, {{m|en|more}}, {{m|en|less}}, {{m|en|this}}, and {{m|en|that}}.

==Luxembourgish==

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|lb|af}}, {{l|lb|uef}} {{q|both dialectal}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|lb|gmh|af}}, {{m|gmh|ave}}, from {{inh|de|goh|ava}}, northern variant of {{m|gmh|aba}}, from {{inh|lb|gem-pro|*ab}}. Cognate with {{cog|de|ab}}, {{cog|nl|af}}, {{cog|en|of}} and {{m|en|off}}. The expected Luxembourgish forms are {{m|lb|af}} (< {{m|gmh||af}}) and {{m|lb|uef}} (< {{m|gmh||ave}}). The form {{m|lb||of}} is probably a compromise between both variants; otherwise it would imply an irregularly lengthened {{m+|gmh||*āf}}, {{m|gmh||*āve}}.

====Usage notes====
* ''Of'' does not mean "of," even though it's where the word "of" comes from. Instead, the Anglo-Saxons mostly used the [[genitive case]] where we would say "of": ''<u>Dēaðes</u> god man sċeal ofslēan and mann undēadlīcne dōn'' ("The god <u>of death</u> must be killed and man made immortal"), ''Iċ hine huntiġe oþ <u>eorðan</u> endas'' ("I'll hunt him to the ends <u>of the Earth</u>"). Even the occasional instances where "of" translates ''of'' are a survival of its original sense "from" or "out of": ''sē weall is ġeworht <u>of</u> tiġelan and eorþteorwe'' ("the wall is made <u>of</u> brick and asphalt"), ''Sē Hǣlend sċolde bēon <u>of</u> fǣmnan ġeboren'' ("Jesus was supposedly born <u>of</u> a virgin").

* Note also that ''of'' never means "about." Phrases like "to think of" and "to speak of" are rendered with {{m|ang|be}} or {{m|ang|ymb}}.

* For doing something "out of" an emotion, {{m|ang|for}} is typically used instead of ''of'': ''Þætte <u>for</u> lufum ġedōn biþ þæt ġewierþ simle beġeondan gōde and yfele'' ("What is done <u>out of</u> love always takes place beyond good and evil").
