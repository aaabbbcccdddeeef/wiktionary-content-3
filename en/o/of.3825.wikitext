=====Usage notes=====
* {{sense|belonging to or associated with}} When applied to a person or persons, the possessive is generally used instead.
* {{sense|containing, comprising{{,}} or made from}} {{m|en||Of}} may be used directly with a verb or adjectival phrase.
* When modifying a noun, modern English increasingly uses [[noun adjunct]]s rather than '''''of'''''. Examples include ''[[part of speech]]'' (16th century) vs. ''[[word class]]'' (20th century), ''{{w|Federal Bureau of Investigation}}'' (1908) vs. ''{{w|Central Intelligence Agency}}'' (1947), and ''affairs of the world'' (18th century) vs. ''world affairs'' (20th century).
* The use of {{m|en|of}} to link nouns to attributive adjectives modified by certain adverbs is always optional; omitting {{m|en|of}} in such instances is always permissible and does not alter the meaning of the expression. Adverbs that may be used with this construction include {{m|en|too}}, {{m|en|so}}, {{m|en|how}}, {{m|en|as}}, {{m|en|more}}, {{m|en|less}}, {{m|en|this}}, and {{m|en|that}}.
