# {{lb|en|archaic}} [[drunk]]; [[intoxicated]]
#* '''1863''', Sheridan Le Fanu, ''{{w|The House by the Churchyard}}''
#*: Indeed, he was 'dithguthted' at his condition; and if upon the occasion just described he had allowed himself to be somewhat 'intoxicated with liquor,' I must aver that I do not recollect another instance in which this worthy little gentleman suffered himself to be similarly '''overtaken'''. Now and then a little '[[flashy]]' he might be, but nothing more serious—and rely upon it, this was no common virtue in those days.
