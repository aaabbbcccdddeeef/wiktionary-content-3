===Etymology===
{{etyl|ang}} {{term|ar|ār|lang=ang}} / {{term|ar|āra|lang=ang|unwrought metal}}. MORPHOLOGY: (The O.E. word,''āra'', dropped the initial ''ā''-sound, and the remainder, ''-ra'', evolved into a word whose sound [in its '''past participle''' form with "-''ed''"] approached the modern English, "ROT."

Due to the fact that weapons and shallow-hulled water-craft were integral for antiquated, Germanic tribes (''Jutes'', ''Angles'', ''Saxons'', ...) to defend, and further expand, their territories. Metals also enabled thse tribes to fashion banding and structural reinforcements for their river-penetrating boats, as well as ''fish hooks'', whose designs are unique to each tribe, and thereby enable archaeologists to assign probable, tribal affiliations. Each of these tribes were cognately-named (i.e., '''''ANGLES''''' < "angle [of hook]" + '''''JUTES''''' < "jut (the 'pointing out'...) [of hook]" + '''''SAXONS''''' < Olde English: ''seax'' "[sword]."

As of recent times, usage within geologic and -- more saliently -- economic senses, an "''ore''" is a rock whose intrinsic ''mineral'', or ''element''-al, composition would yield a monetary, or material, value that would exceed those costs accumulated by its evaluation and testing, extraction, and subsequent processing.
