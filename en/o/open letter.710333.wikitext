|passage=For months, Dati warned she would refuse to stand aside. Now she has stunned the political class with an '''open letter''' to Fillon in ''{{w|Le Monde}}'', a scathing character assassination accusing him of the "lone ambition" of a disillusioned political elite, of doing politics in a way that "never favoured women" and stopping ethnic-minority candidates from progressing at elections. She said he was committing "a sad mistake" in trying to run in Paris.}}
