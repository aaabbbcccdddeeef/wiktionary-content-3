===Noun===
{{en-noun|otaku|otaku}}
# A term for a fan extremely obsessed with [[anime]] or [[manga]], used teasingly or sometimes self-applied.

====Note====
In Japanese culture, this is a derogatory term for an extremely obsessed person. That obsession can be for anything such as anime, computers, celebrities, etc. However, in western culture, it is not so much a derogatory term as a teasing term. It is sometimes self-applied by anime’s more extreme fans. In general, it’s better to avoid the use of this word as the term is very derogatory in Japan.
