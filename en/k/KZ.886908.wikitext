===Etymology===
The expected initialism {{m|de|KL}} was used officially at least in the earlier years of the National Socialist concentration camps. While it is not entirely clear how the informal variant {{m|de|KZ}} originated, it is usually thought that it came to be preferred and eventually standardised due to its sounding harsher. A possible origin is from the fact that the common German pronunciation of {{m|de|Konzentrationslager}} contains the cluster {{IPAchar|[ts]}}, predominantly represented in German by the letter Z, three times: {{IPAchar|[ˌkɔn.'''ts'''ɛn.tʁaˈ'''ts'''joːn'''ts'''ˌlaːɡɐ]}}. Another theory derives it from {{m|de|Zuchthaus|t=prison with aggravated conditions of detention}}, which at least officially, however, was never used for the camps.
