* In some old texts, the form "know to [verb]" rather than "know how to [verb]" is found, e.g. Milton wrote "he knew himself <!--this is where 'how' would go-->to sing, and build the lofty rhymes".

*: O, that a man might '''know''' / The end of this day's business ere it come! / But it sufficeth that the day will end, / And then the end is '''known'''.
