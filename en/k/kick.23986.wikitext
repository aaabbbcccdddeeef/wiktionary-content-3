==English==
===Etymology===
From the late 14th century, likely of Old Norse origin, possibly from ''kikna'' "bend backwards, sink at the knees" (c.f. German ''[[knicken]]''). The oldest use is biblcal, rendering [[λακτίζω]] ("to strike with the heel, kick", metaphorically of an ox) in Acts 9:5.
The noun is from the verb, attested from ca. 1530.
