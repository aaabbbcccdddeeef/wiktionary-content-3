# {{sense|Zen Buddhism}}  A [[word]] [[shout]]ed out in [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], (as well as other [[sect]]s of Buddhism), and in [[East]] [[Asian]] martial arts [[school]]s, used to help [[focus]] one's [[energy]], ([[気]] ([[き]], ''[[ki]]''), and therefore induce an [[enlightened]] [[state]] of oneself or another.
