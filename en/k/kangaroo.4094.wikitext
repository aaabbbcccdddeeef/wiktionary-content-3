===Pronunciation===
*[[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:/,kæŋgə'ru:/

===Etymology===
From the Guugu Yimidhirr language word ''gangurru'', referring to the Eastern Grey Kangaroo (''Macropus giganteus''). The name was first recorded as ''kangaru'' by Joseph Banks on the banks of the Endeavour River at the site of modern Cooktown. 

''Kangaroo'' soon became adopted into standard English where it has come to mean any member of the family of kangaroos and wallabies.

In a widely circulating myth, [[Lieutenant]] (later [[Captain]]) James Cook is supposed to have asked a native "What is that?" to which the reply "kangaroo", meaning "I don't understand" was given. This story, although amusing, is completely untrue.
