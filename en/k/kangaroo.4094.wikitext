===Etymology===
From the [[Guugu Yimidhirr]] language word ''[[gangurru]]'', recorded by [w:James Cook|James Cook]] and others in 1770 at [[w:Endeavour River|Endeavour River]].  But in English applied to the whole [[macropod]] family, apparently from not realizing the Guugu Yimidhirr word was just one species.  (And the pronunciation anglicized.)

In 1820 [[w:Phillip King|Phillip King]] visited the area and could not confirm Cook's record and some suggested Cook and Banks had erred.  This is apparently the basis for the long-standing myth that Cook is supposed to have asked a native "What is that?" to which the reply "kangaroo", meaning "I don't know" was given.  Though amusing, this is not the case.  John Haviland studied Guugu Yimidhirr extensively in 1972, confirming ''gangurru'' and concluding King had been told ''[[minha]]''.
