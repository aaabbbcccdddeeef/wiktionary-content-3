===Pronunciation===
*[[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:/,kæŋgə'ru:/

===Etymology===
From [[Guugu Yimidhirr]] (an Australian Aboriginal language) ''[[gangurru]]'' meaning a large grey or black kangaroo.  Recorded as ''kangooroo'' and ''kanguru'' by [[w:James Cook|Captain Cook]] and his party when stopped at [[w:Endeavour River|Endeavour River]] in [[Queensland]] in July 1770.

In a widely circulating myth Captain Cook is supposed to have asked a native "What is that?" to which the reply "kangaroo", meaning "I don't understand" was given. This story, although amusing, is completely untrue.

#: 1770: ''Besides the Animals which I have before mentioned, called by the Natives Kangooroo, or Kanguru ...'' &mdash; [[w:James Cook|James Cook]], ''Captain Cook's Journal During the First Voyage Round the World'', description of Endeavour River, at 4 August 1770 [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8106]
