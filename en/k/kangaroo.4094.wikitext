===Etymology===
From the [[w:Guugu Yimidhirr|Guugu Yimidhirr]] aboriginal language word ''[[gangurru]]'', referring to the [[w:eastern grey kangaroo|eastern grey kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus''). The name was recorded by [[Lieutenant]] (later [[Captain]]) [[w:James Cook|James Cook]] and others in 1770 (quote below) while at [[w:Endeavour River|Endeavour River]].  In English ''kangaroo'' refers to any of the various kangaroo species, but its root ''gangurru'' refers only to the eastern grey (other species have their own names).  (Reference: ''Macquarie Aboriginal Words'', [[w:Macquarie University|Macquarie University]], 1994, paperback ISBN 0-949757-79-9, introduction page xxi.)

In a widely circulating myth, Cook is supposed to have asked a native "What is that?" to which the reply "kangaroo", meaning "I don't understand" was given. This story, although amusing, is completely untrue.
