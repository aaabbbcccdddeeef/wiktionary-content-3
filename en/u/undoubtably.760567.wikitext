====Usage notes====
* "Undoubtably" is considered to be [[nonstandard]] English by some authorities, and the term is seldom found in modern literary writing.<ref>See, for example, the list of spelling "disturbances" in Melvene M. Draheim, "The Oral Approach in Problems of Writing" (''The English Journal'', vol. 34, no. 9, Nov. 1945, p. 484) or the inclusion of "undoubtably" in the humorous paragraph depicting spelling errors and nonstandard usages by college students in Loy E. Davis, "And Gladly Teach" (''College English'', vol. 17, no. 3, Dec. 1955, p. 150).</ref> The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' provides no examples of usage after 1513 and characterizes "undoubtably" as "''? Obs.''," wondering whether the term is obsolete.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed., 1989.</ref>  Nevertheless, many examples of its usage can be found in 20th- and 21st-century popular English and in contemporary academic journals.
