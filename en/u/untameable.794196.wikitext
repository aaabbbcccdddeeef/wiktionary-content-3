#*: “My lord,” said Mary, “it seems to me that you fling on my unhappy and devoted head those evils, which, with far more justice, I may impute to your own turbulent, wild, and '''untameable''' dispositions.”
#* '''1869''', {{w|Alfred Russel Wallace}}, ''{{w|The Malay Archipelago}}'', Volume II, Chapter 27,<sup>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2539/2539-8.txt]</sup>
#*: Of all the carnivorous animals of the Archipelago the only one found in the Moluccas is the {{w|Viverra tangalunga}}, which inhabits both Batchian and Bouru, and probably come of the other islands. I am inclined to think that this also may have been introduced accidentally, for it is often made captive by the Malays, who procure civet from it, and it is an animal very restless and '''untameable''', and therefore likely to escape.
