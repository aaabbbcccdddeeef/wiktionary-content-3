#* {{quote-journal|en|date=2019 October 23|author=Pip Dunn|title=The next king of Scotland|journal=Rail|page=54|text=The ride quality is pure [[HST]] - you have a smoother ride than on any '''underfloor''' [[DMU]], aided by less intrusive noise. Sitting at the end of the coaches (and thus over the bogies) is obviously that bit bouncier, but in the centre of the trailer cars it's lovely - and much better than so many new trains such as Voyagers or Class 180s... in fact, anything with those dreaded '''underfloor''' engines.}}
