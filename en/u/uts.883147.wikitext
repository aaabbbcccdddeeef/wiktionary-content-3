===Etymology===
Usually derived from {{etyl|ine-pro|lv}} {{m|ine-pro|*wēt-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*wet-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*ut-}}, from the stem {{m|ine-pro|*wē-||to blow}} (whence also {{etyl|la|-}} {{m|lv|vējš||wind}}, [[q.v.]]) with a suffix ''-t''. [[w:lv:Jānis Endzelīns|J. Endzelīns]], connecting this word to {{cog|prg|wutris||blacksmith}}, and noting the ancient link between the notions of “forging” and “pricking, piercing” (compare {{cog|lv|kalt||to forge}}, {{cog|ru|колоть||to pierce|tr=kolót'}}), suggested that the original meaning of {{m|lv|uts}} was “that which pierces; stitch.” Another opinion is that {{m|lv|uts}} (via {{m|ine-pro|*wet-}}, with a suffix ''-t'') derives from Proto-Indo-European {{m|ine-pro|*eu-||to feel}} (whence also {{cog|lv|just||to
feel}}, [[q.v.]]), so that its original meaning would have been “that which is felt, which irritates.” A third suggestion is that {{m|lv|uts}} comes from Proto-Indo-European {{m|ine-pro|*lus}}, {{m|ine-pro|*luH||louse}} (compare {{etyl|lt|-}} {{m|lv|liulė|liũlė}}, {{cog|de|Laus}}, {{cog|en|louse}}), a word which many daughter languages altered or abandoned, perhaps because of linguistic taboos; in the Baltic case, only the middle ''u'' would have been kept, with an extra suffix ''-t''. Cognates include {{cog|lt|utėlė̃}}, dialectal {{m|lt|utė̃}}, {{m|lt|utìs}}.<ref>{{R:lv:LEV}}</ref>
