===Etymology===
Usually derived from {{etyl|ine-pro|lv}} {{recons|wēt-|lang=ine-pro}}, {{recons|wet-|lang=ine-pro}}, {{recons|ut-|lang=ine-pro}}, from the stem {{recons|wē-||to blow|lang=ine-pro}} (whence also {{etyl|la|-}} {{term|vējš||wind|lang=lv}}, [[q.v.]]) with a suffix ''-t''. [[w:lv:Jānis Endzelīns|J. Endzelīns]], connecting this word to {{etyl|prg|-}} {{term|wutris||blacksmith|lang=prg}}, and noting the ancient link between the notions of “forging” and “pricking, piercing” (cf. {{etyl|lv|-}} {{term|kalt||to forge|lang=lv}}, {{etyl|ru|-}} {{term|колоть||to pierce|tr=kolót'|lang=ru}}), suggested that the original meaning of {{term|uts|lang=lv}} was “that which pierces; stitch.” Another opinion is that {{term|uts|lang=lv}} (via {{recons|wet-}}, with a suffix ''-t'') derives from Proto-Indo-European {{recons|eu-||to feel|lang=ine-pro}} (whence also {{etyl|lv|-}} {{term|just||to feel|lang=lv}}, [[q.v.]]), so that its original meaning would have been “that which is felt, which irritates.” A third suggestion is that {{term|uts|lang=lv}} comes from Proto-Indo-European {{recons|lus|lang=ine-pro}}, {{recons|luH||louse|lang=ine-pro}} (cf. {{etyl|lt|-}} {{term|liulė|liũlė|lang=lv}}, {{etyl|de|-}} {{term|Laus|lang=de}}, {{etyl|en|-}} {{term|louse|lang=en}}), a word which many daughter languages altered or abandoned, perhaps because of linguistic taboos; in the Baltic case, only the middle ''u'' would have been kept, with an extra suffix ''-t''. Cognates include {{etyl|lt|-}} {{term|utėlė̃|utėlė|lang=lt}}, dialectal {{term|utė|utė̃|lang=lt}}, {{term|utis|utìs|lang=lt}}.<ref>Karulis, Konstantīns. 1992, 2001.
