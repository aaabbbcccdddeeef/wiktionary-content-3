===Etymology===
Usually derived from {{etyl|ine-pro|lv}} {{m|ine-pro|*wēt-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*wet-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*ut-}}, from the stem {{m|ine-pro|*wē-||to blow}} (whence also {{etyl|la|-}} {{term|vējš||wind|lang=lv}}, [[q.v.]]) with a suffix ''-t''. [[w:lv:Jānis Endzelīns|J. Endzelīns]], connecting this word to {{etyl|prg|-}} {{term|wutris||blacksmith|lang=prg}}, and noting the ancient link between the notions of “forging” and “pricking, piercing” (compare {{etyl|lv|-}} {{term|kalt||to forge|lang=lv}}, {{etyl|ru|-}} {{term|колоть||to pierce|tr=kolót'|lang=ru}}), suggested that the original meaning of {{term|uts|lang=lv}} was “that which pierces; stitch.” Another opinion is that {{term|uts|lang=lv}} (via {{m|ine-pro|*wet-}}, with a suffix ''-t'') derives from Proto-Indo-European {{m|ine-pro|*eu-||to feel}} (whence also {{etyl|lv|-}} {{term|just||to feel|lang=lv}}, [[q.v.]]), so that its original meaning would have been “that which is felt, which irritates.” A third suggestion is that {{term|uts|lang=lv}} comes from Proto-Indo-European {{m|ine-pro|*lus}}, {{m|ine-pro|*luH||louse}} (compare {{etyl|lt|-}} {{term|liulė|liũlė|lang=lv}}, {{etyl|de|-}} {{term|Laus|lang=de}}, {{etyl|en|-}} {{term|louse|lang=en}}), a word which many daughter languages altered or abandoned, perhaps because of linguistic taboos; in the Baltic case, only the middle ''u'' would have been kept, with an extra suffix ''-t''. Cognates include {{etyl|lt|-}} {{term|utėlė̃|lang=lt}}, dialectal {{term|utė̃|lang=lt}}, {{term|utìs|lang=lt}}.<ref>{{R:lv:LEV}}</ref>
