# {{context|palaeography}} The earliest style of [[Cyrillic]] writing developed from Greek [[uncial]] in the late 9th century, predominant in the 11th–14th centuries.

====Usage notes====
{{term||Ustav}} and {{term|poluustav}} writing is often referred to as Cyrillic {{term|uncial}} and {{term|semi-uncial}} script, but the comparison to the Western European style is considered inadequate by some palaeographers, so the Slavic words are also used in English-language writing.

Usually italicized.
