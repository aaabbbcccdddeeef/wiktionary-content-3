====Usage notes====
{{m|en||Ustav}} and {{m|en|poluustav}} writing is often referred to as Cyrillic {{m|en|uncial}} and {{m|en|semi-uncial}} script, but the comparison to the Western European style is considered inadequate by some palaeographers, so the Slavic words are also used in English-language writing.

Usually italicized.
