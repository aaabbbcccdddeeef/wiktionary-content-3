{{en-noun|sg=''ustav''|pl='''''[[ustavs]]'''''}}

# {{context|palaeography}} The earliest style of [[Cyrillic]] writing developed from Greek [[uncial]] in the late 9th century, predominant in the 11th–14th centuries.
#: The handsomely fashioned writing is of the type described as '''''polu-ustav''''' (semi-uncial), which is midway between the stately '''''ustav''''' and the cursive, . . . —A. Aronson, ''Rabindranath Through Western Eyes''
# {{Eastern Orthodoxy}} A church [[statute]] prescribing daily prayer, [[feast day]]s, and [[fast]]s.

====Derived terms====
* {{sense|palaeography}} ''[[poluustav]], [[polu-ustav]]'', [[semi-ustav]]

====Usage notes====
{{term||Ustav}} and {{term|poluustav}} writing is often referred to as Cyrillic {{term|uncial}} and {{term|semi-uncial}} script, but the comparison to the Western European style is considered inadequate by some palaeographers, so the Slavic words are also used in English-language writing.

Usually italicized.
