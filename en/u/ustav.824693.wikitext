===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{context|palaeography|lang=en}} The earliest style of [[Cyrillic]] writing developed from Greek [[uncial]] in the late 9th century, predominant in the 11th–14th centuries.
#: The handsomely fashioned writing is of the type described as '''''polu-ustav''''' (semi-uncial), which is midway between the stately '''''ustav''''' and the cursive, . . . —A. Aronson, ''Rabindranath Through Western Eyes''
# {{context|Eastern Orthodoxy|lang=en}} A church [[statute]] prescribing daily prayer, [[feast day]]s, and [[fast]]s.
#: While most of the service books are employed only in the conduct of public devotion, the psalter and the '''''ustav''''' are widely read works that are found in every household. —David Scheffel, ''In the Shadow of Antichrist: The Old Believers of Alberta''

====Synonyms====
* {{sense|palaeography}} [[uncial]]
* {{sense|Eastern Orthodoxy}} ''[[typikon]]'', ''[[typicon]]''

====Derived terms====
* {{sense|palaeography}} ''[[poluustav]], [[polu-ustav]]'', [[semi-ustav]]

====Usage notes====
{{term||Ustav}} and {{term|poluustav}} writing is often referred to as Cyrillic {{term|uncial}} and {{term|semi-uncial}} script, but the comparison to the Western European style is considered inadequate by some palaeographers, so the Slavic words are also used in English-language writing.

Usually italicized.
