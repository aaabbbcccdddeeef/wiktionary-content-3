# The state of being [[unsound]].
#* '''1951''', John Wyndham, ''The Day of the Triffids''
#*: Most likely he was accounting for that by the bias my job might be expected to give – aggravated by a phobia resulting from my recent sting – and he was wondering whether it might connote other, perhaps less harmless, '''unsoundnesses'''.
