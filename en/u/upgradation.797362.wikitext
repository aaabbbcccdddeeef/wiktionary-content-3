===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{nonstandard}} Term used by Indian and other off-shore contractors incorrectly to describe the process of performing an upgrade of an IT software system.  It is widely found in CV's submitted to IT managers in high cost countries looking for low cost resources - often a source of much confusion.

===Usage notes===
This is a classic case of mixing a verb with a noun made worse by the fact that the base verb would actually need to be "upgradate" [sic] which is equally grammatically insufficient.  While perhaps acceptable in Indian English morphology, its use is likely to meet extensive derision in other dialects.
