# {{nonstandard}} {{upgrade|Upgrade]]; [[upgrading]].

===Usage notes===
Term often used by Indian and other off-shore contractors incorrectly to describe the process of performing an upgrade of an IT software system.  It is widely found in CV's - often a source of much confusion.
This is a classic case of mixing a verb with a noun made worse by the fact that the base verb would actually need to be "upgradate" [sic] which is equally grammatically insufficient.  While perhaps acceptable in Indian English morphology, its use is likely to meet derision in other dialects.
