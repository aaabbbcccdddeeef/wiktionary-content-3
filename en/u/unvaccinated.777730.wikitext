|text=Which brings me to the difficult choice we face on coronavirus vaccinations. The conventional wisdom is that there is some argument, yet unmade and perhaps undiscovered, that will change the minds of the roughly 30 percent of American adults who haven’t gotten at least one dose. There probably isn’t. The '''unvaccinated''' often hold their views strongly, and many are making considered, cost-benefit calculations, given how they weigh the risks of the virus, and the information sources they trust to inform them of those risks.}}
