Uttaranchal borders [[Tibet]] in the north-east and [[Nepal]] to the south-east, while its neighbour states are [[Himachal Pradesh]] and Uttar Pradesh. The provisional capital of Uttaranchal is [[Dehradun]] which is also a rail-head and largest city in the region. The small hamlet of [[Gairsen]] has been mooted as a future capital owing to its geographic centrality. The High Court of Uttaranchal is situated in the district of [[Nainital]]. The region is also known as [[Uttarakhand]], which derives from the Sanskrit for ''North Country''.

Uttaranchal has traditionally been divided into two parts, the western half known as [[Garhwal]] and the eastern region going by the name of [[Kumaon]].
