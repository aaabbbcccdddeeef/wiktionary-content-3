#* '''1895''', [[w:Robert W. Chambers|Robert W. Chambers]], page 107 of "The Yellow Sign", in ''[[s:The King in Yellow|The King in Yellow]]'',
#*: {{...|I thanked Heaven for it, not that it being a Catholic I had any repugnance for the congregation next door, but because}} my nerves were shattered by a blatant exhorter, {{...|whose every word echoed through the aisle of the church as if it had been my own rooms, and}} who insisted on his '''r’s''' with a nasal persistence which revolted my every instinct. {{...|Then, too, there was a fiend in human shape, an organist, who reeled off some of the grand old hymns with an interpretation of his own, and I longed for the blood of a creature who could play the doxology with an amendment of minor chords which one hears only in a quartet of very young undergraduates.}} I believe the minister was a good man, but when he bellowed: “And the Lorrrd said unto Moses, the Lorrrd is a man of war; the Lorrrd is his name.
