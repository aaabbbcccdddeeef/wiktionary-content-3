# The [[chemical element]] ([[symbol]] [[Ra]]) with an [[atomic number]] of 88. It is a [[soft]], [[shiny]] and [[silvery]] [[radioactive]] [[alkaline earth metal]].
#* {{quote-book|en|author=Ernest Howard Adye|chapter=Radio-active Elements|mainauthor={{w|Frank Rutley}}|title=Mineralogy|series=Murby’s “Science and Art Department” Series of Text-books|edition=15th revised and corrected|location=London|publisher=Thomas Murby & Co.,{{nb...|6, Bouverie Street, E.C. and all booksellers.}}|year=1902|page=234|pageurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eT_V-BPBC7sC&pg=PA234|oclc=933013601|passage=Madame [[w:Marie Curie|[Marie] Curie]], working with her distinguished husband, isolated and first traced to its true origin the source of the marvellous power which has thus commenced to revolutionise our philosophy of physics. This new element has appropriately been named "'''''Radium''''';" but it has also been shown that there are many other, though less powerful, radio-active elements, details of which are recorded in the sequel. To be precise, '''radium''', ''per se'', has not yet been isolated as a metal, but only in the form of salts,—chlorides and bromides. [...] It is supposed that the molecules of '''radium''' (composed of similar atoms) during their decomposition into those of the gas helium, are also frittered down into heat and, in part, are liberated as radio-activity.}}

Filters, beakers, and dishes used in the laboratory for operations with '''radium''', after having been washed in the usual way, remain radio-active: a piece of blende screen held inside the beaker or other vessel immediately glowing with the presence of '''radium'''.}}
