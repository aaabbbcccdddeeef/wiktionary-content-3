# The [[chemical element]] ([[symbol]] [[Ra]]) with an [[atomic number]] of 88. It is a [[soft]], [[shiny]] and [[silvery]] [[radioactive]] [[alkaline earth metal]].

This new element has appropriately been named "'''''Radium''''';" but it has also been shown that there are many other, though less powerful, radio-active elements, details of which are recorded in the sequel. To be precise, '''radium''', ''per se'', has not yet been isolated as a metal, but only in the form of salts,—chlorides and bromides. [...] It is supposed that the molecules of '''radium''' (composed of similar atoms) during their decomposition into those of the gas helium, are also frittered down into heat and, in part, are liberated as radio-activity.}}
