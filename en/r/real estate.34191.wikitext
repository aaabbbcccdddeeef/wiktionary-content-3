===Etymology===
[[real]]; from French [[royale]], from Latin [[regalis]], royal, regal, from combining form [[reg-]] (nominative rex), king, + adjective suffix [[-alis]] 

[[estate]]; from Latin [[status]], condition, state 

In spite of the name, real estate has no connection with the concept of [[reality]]. It derives instead from the [[feudal]] principle that in a [[monarchy]], all land was considered the property of the king. Thus originally the term real estate was equivalent to "royal estate", real originating from the French royale, as it was the French-speaking Normans who introduced [[feudalism]] to England in the [[11th century]] and thus the English language; [[cognate]] to [[Spanish]] ''real''.

===Noun===

# [[property]] that cannot easily be moved, usually [[building]]s and the [[ground]] they are built on
