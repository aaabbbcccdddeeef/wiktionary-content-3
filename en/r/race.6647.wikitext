===Etymology 2===
1560s, via {{bor|en|frm|race}} from {{der|en|it|razza}} (early 14th century), of {{unk|en|title=uncertain}} origin.
{{rel-top|theories}}
* Diez and some other scholars suggest derivation from {{der|en|gem-pro|*raitō}} (whence {{cog|goh|reiza|t=line}} and {{cog|non|ríta|t=to score, log, outline}}), perhaps via {{der|en|lng|*raiza|t=line}}, which Körting notes is a literal rendering of {{der|en|la|[[linea]] [[sanguinis]]|t=bloodline of descent}}.<ref name="Voeg">Eric Voegelin, ''The History of the Race Idea: From Ray to Carus'', volume 3</ref><!-- Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke calls this "conceptually difficult"; others disagree.--> Anatoly Liberman says "the semantic fit is good" but the chronology falters; he says the Germanic word went out of use before the Italian word arose, and he says the intermediary is not attested.<ref name="Lib">Anatoly Liberman, ''[http://blog.oup.com/2009/04/race-2/ The Oxford Etymologist Looks at Race, Class and Sex (but not Gender), or, Beating a Willing Horse]''</ref>
* Some scholars suggest derivation from {{cog|osp|raza}}, {{m|osp|rasa}}, from earlier {{m|osp|ras}}, {{m|osp|res|t=head of cattle}}, from {{der|en|ar|رَأْس|t=head}}, but {{cog|it|razza}} predates the Spanish word according to Diez and Meyer-Lübke.<ref>Diez, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der romanischen Sprachen'', "Razza."</ref><ref name="Voeg"/>
* Meyer-Lübke suggested {{cog|la|generatio}} as the root; Körting says "the disappearance of ''two'' initial syllables hardly seems credible", but Meyer-Lübke notes the Venetian form ''narazza'' and the Old Bellunesian form ''naraccia'',<!-- and says that ''generatio'' is the source of Old French ''generace''--> positing that after the first syllable ''ge-'' was lost, the remaining ''(una) narazza'' came to be reanalysed as ''una razza''.<ref name="Voeg"/>
* Gianfranco Contini suggests the Italian word comes from {{der|en|fro|haraz|t=troop of horses}},<ref>Giacomo Devoto, ''Avviamento all'etimologia italiana'', Mondadori</ref> whence Modern {{cog|fr|haras|t=breeding farm for horses; stud farm}}, from {{der|en|non|hárr|t=grey-haired; hoary}}. Liberman considers this derivation the most likely.<ref name="Lib"/>
* Other suggested Latin etyma:
** {{m|la|radius}} (perhaps via {{cog|VL.|*radia}}) (per Baist).<ref name="Voeg"/>
** {{m|la|radix|t=root}} (per Ulrich);<ref name="Voeg"/> Liberman says "the semantic match is excellent", and {{m|en|race|t=rhizome of ginger}} (which definitely derives from ''radix'') shows that the phonology is plausible.<ref name="Lib"/>
** {{m|la|*raptiare|t=breed falcons}} (per Körting).<ref name="Voeg"/><ref name="Lib"/>
** The nominative of {{m|la|ratio}} (perhaps via an unattested intermediate form *''razzo''), as opposed to {{m|it|ragione}} which derives from the accusative ''rationem''.<!--, which nonetheless was attested with a similar sense to ''razza'' in the late Middle Ages [according to ...?]-->
* Other implausible suggestions include Slavic ''raz''<ref name="Lib"/><ref name="Voeg"/> and Basque ''arraca'', supposedly meaning "stud animal"<ref name="Lib"/> (Basque ''arrazza'', "race", derives from Spanish).
