===Etymology===
From {{der|en|la|retectionem||to uncover or disclose}}.<ref>It has been claimed that in 2002 a paper to be titled "Powder detection using THz imaging" (by Wang, Ferguson, Manella, Abbot and Zhang), the title was mistakenly published as "Powder '''retection''' using THz imaging" in ''OSA Trends in Optics and Photonics, Proceedings of Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics'', vol. 73. (recounted in ''Proceedings of the IEEE'', vol. 95, No. 8 August 2007, page 1511, ''Scanning the Issue: T-Ray Imaging, Sensing and Retection'' by Derek Abbott and Xi-Cheng Zhang), and that this influenced some modern uses of the word.</ref>
