===Pronunciation===
*: {{rhymes|ɜː(r)}}

===Etymology===
From {{term|re-}} + {{term|inter}}.

===Verb===
{{en-verb|reinters|reinterring|reinterred}}

# {{transitive}} To re-[[bury]] in a [[grave]].

====Usage notes====
* This term is equally applicable whether the new interment is into the same grave as previously (as might happen after a body is exhumed for a medical autopsy) or into a new one (as might happen if a body was originally buried in a place later deemed inappropriate).
* The spellings {{term|reintering}} (for {{term|reinterring}}) and {{term|reintered}} (for {{term|reinterred}}) exist as well, but are much less common.
