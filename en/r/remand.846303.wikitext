===Etymology===
Remand is a legal term which has two related but distinct usages. Its etymology is from the Latin re- and mandare, literally "to order." It evolved in Late Latin to remandare, or "to send back word." It appears in Middle French as remander and in Middle English as remaunden, both with essentially the same meaning, "to send back."

# The [[act]] of sending an [[accused]] person back into [[custody]] whilst awaiting [[trial]].
# The act of an [[appellate]] [[court]] [[send]]ing a matter back to a [[lower court]] for [[review]] or [[disposal]].

===Verb===
{{en-verb}}

# To send a [[prisoner]] back to [[custody]].<ref>A modern legal definition includes the possibility of [[bail]] being granted, so in the [[United Kingdom]] at least, this does not necessarily imply custody: {{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1976/cukpga_19760063_en_1 |title= |publisher=www.opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-04-02 }}</ref>
