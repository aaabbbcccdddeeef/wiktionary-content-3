===Etymology 1===
From {{der|en|fro|retranchier||to get rid of, remove}} (modern {{cog|fr|retrancher||to cut out, take away; to cut off; to cut down}}), from {{m|fro|re-||''suffix meaning ‘again’''}} + {{m|fro|tranchier}}, {{m|fro|trenchier||to cut}} (modern {{cog|fr|trancher||to slice}}); further etymology uncertain, but possibly either from {{der|en|VL.|*trinicāre||cut in three parts}} (from the root {{m|la|trini}} from {{m|la|trēs||three}}, based on the model of {{m|la|duplicāre||to double by dividing, split in two, tear}}), or from an alteration of {{der|en|la|truncāre||to maim by cutting off pieces; to truncate}}, also possibly influenced by {{der|en|cel-gau|*trincare||to cut (the head)}}. ''Compare'' {{cog|en|trench}}.
