#*:The camp was in two lines separated by paddy fields; a great tank covered the left flank of both lines. At 300 yards in front of this tank, but a little on its left, was another, and farther on, likewise on the left of this, another, neither more than 200 yards in circumference, and both dry; and the bank which surrounded the foremost tank had been converted into a retrenchment, in which were mounted some pieces of cannon, which commanded the plain in front, and flanked in its whole length the esplanade in front of the camp.

#*:From this time, the hand which had ever been ready to supply all our wants real or imaginary, opened less promptly at our demands. My father talked occasionally of '''retrenchment''' and economy when some of our extravagant bills came in; but we paid little heed to his remarks on this head. Where could we retrench? In what could we economize? The very idea was absurd.
