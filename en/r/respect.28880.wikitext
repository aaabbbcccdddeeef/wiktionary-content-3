====Usage notes====
It is possible that a confusion between the different meanings of ''respect'' affects the attitudes of people and organizations. For example, [[freedom of religion]] implies that we must respect '''the right of anyone''' to believe whatever they wish, to act within the law in accordance with their beliefs, and not to be discriminated against on account of their beliefs. However, the use of the word ''respect'' seems to have shifted our attitudes towards the quite different notion that we must behave respectfully towards their beliefs, and not criticise them. This is a restriction on [[freedom of speech]], and is inherently hypocritical&mdash;anyone with any view on religion must necessarily believe that those who believe differently are deluded, although their rights must be respected.

The distinction between the two meanings can be shown by paraphrasing Voltaire: "I totally disrespect what you say, but absolutely respect your right to say it."
