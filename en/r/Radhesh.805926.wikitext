'''Radhesh''' is a [[Hindi]] word meaning ''radha + eesh''--> ''Lord Krishna''.....

Many Indians use this word as name for identification. 
and is quite different and stylish too ..  (:P)
one of them is the person who is writing this article to explain the meaning of it ! 

do not confuse it with similar words like ''rajesh'' or ''rakesh'' etc... 
they have different meanings !
