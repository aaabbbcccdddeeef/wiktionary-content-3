|text=In just over 350 years, a nation of nearly 200 million people has grown up, populated almost entirely by persons who either came from other lands or whose forefathers came from other lands. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt reminded a convention of the Daughters of the American Revolution, “Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and '''revolutionists'''.”}}

#*: The work of the incendiaries of 1792 was only to be finished by the petroleurs of 1871. Night was come. A great number of the Parisian population were groaning, but the '''revolutionists''' triumphed with joy.
