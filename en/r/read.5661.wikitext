===Etymology===
English is the one of the few western European languages that does not derive its verb for “to read” from Latin legere. Compare, for example, leggere in Italian, lire in French, and lesen in German. (Equally surprising is the fact that English is the only western European language not to derive its verb for “to write” from Latin ''[[scribere]]''.) Read comes from the Old English verb rdan, “to advise, interpret (something difficult), interpret (something written), read.” Rdan is related to the German verb raten, “to advise” (as in Rathaus, “townhall”). The Old English noun rd, “counsel,” survives in the rare noun rede, “counsel, advice” and in the name of the unfortunate King Ethelred the Unready, whose epithet is often misunderstood. Unready here does not have its current sense “unprepared” it is a late 16th-century spelling of an earlier unredy, “ill advised, rash, foolish,” from rede.
