{{en-noun}}

# A scene in a television interview, of the interviewer asking a question, which was recorded after the actual interview took place.  The technique is commonly used where only one camera was present at the interview, as a way of creating the appearance of multiple camera angles and showing a scene of the interviewer speaking, rather than the interviewee listening to the question.
