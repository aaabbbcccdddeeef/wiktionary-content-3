# A second or subsequent processing.
## {{lb|en|engineering|nuclear physics}} The process of [[extract]]ing useful or valuable materials from used [[nuclear fuel]], mainly focusing on the recovery of [[fissile]] and [[fertile]] material (primarily [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]], and sometimes [[thorium]] as well) for use in fresh [[nuclear reactor]] [[fuel]], or, in some cases, the [[manufacture]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s (although recovery of [[precious metal]]s produced by [[nuclear fission]] has also been studied).
##: {{ux|en|Nuclear '''reprocessing''' is a highly-controversial issue; proponents point to the massive reduction in the amount of radioactive waste requiring secure disposal, the utilisation of the remaining uranium and plutonium in the used fuel rods which would otherwise go to waste, and the opportunity to recover valuable fission byproducts such as platinum-group metals and silver, while opponents of '''reprocessing''' argue that it delays the switch away from nuclear power and results in massive toxic and radioactive contamination of the '''reprocessing''' sites, and that the separation of useable fissile material presents an unjustifiable proliferation risk.}}
