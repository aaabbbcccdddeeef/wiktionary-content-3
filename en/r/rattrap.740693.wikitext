#* {{quote-text|en|author=[[w:Selma Lagerlöf|Selma Lagerlöf]]|title=The Rattrap|passage=... the whole world with its lands and seas, its cities and villages - was nothing but a big '''rattrap'''. It had never existed for any other purpose than to set baits for people. It offered riches and joys, shelter and food, heat and clothing, exactly as the '''rattrap''' offered cheese and pork, and as soon as anyone let himself be tempted to touch the bait, it closed in on him, and then everything came to an end.}}
# A [[dilapidated]] building, a place that is run down and unsanitary.
# A difficult, entangling situation.
