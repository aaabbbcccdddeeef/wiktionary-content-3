'''ROFL'''

# {{context|internet slang}} Rolling On the Floor, [[Laugh]]ing; used to indicate great amusement at something in a discussion group, etc.
# {{context|rare|dated}} ran out for lunch
# Common variant of ROFLZ, an acronym of internet antiquity, the origin of which is unidentified, but thought to be linked to the mysterious "Brotherhood of the ROFLZ." Little is known about the enigmatic Brotherhood; all those who have sought to investigate their history or membership have themselves disappeared. Their reputed leader, simply known as "Mr. Darcy," is thought to live in a subterranean cave system somewhere below the lost city of Atlantis. To this day, the search continues.
