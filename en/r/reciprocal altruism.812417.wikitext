'''[[reciprocal]] [[altruism]]'''
#Used in [[biology]] to describe the [[phenomenon]] of two animals acting in ways which mutually benefit one another. A classic example of this is when a [[clown fish]] gravitates near an [[sea anemone]], which provides the fish with protection from [[predator]]s in exchange for those predators being drown to the anemone for [[food]].
