{{head|en|verb form}}

# {{past participle of|ring|lang=en|nocat=1}} {{qualifier|only in senses related to a bell}}
# {{lb|en|chiefly|_|dialectal}} {{en-simple past of|ring}}
#* '''1723''', Charles Walker, ''Memoirs of Sally Salisbury'', VI:
#*: With ecchoing Shouts the vaulted Chamber '''rung''', / ''Belle Chuck'' was now the ''TOAST'' of ev'ry Tongue.
#* {{quote-journal|lang=en|journals=Report of State Officers, Board and Committees to the General ...|page=229|books.google.com/books?id=YHYbAQAAIAAJ|South Carolina.

====Adjective====
{{en-adj|-}}

# Of a pig: having a ring through the nose.
#* '''1842''', ''American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine'' (volume 13, page 335)
#*: {{...}} he passed by his gate with a decided scowl on his furrowed brow, and grunting and growling like a newly '''rung''' pig.
#* '''1919''', ''Popular Science'' (volume 95, number 4, page 31)
#*: A "'''rung'''" pig is comfortable as long as he confines his food hunt to the surface of the ground. Ringing a pig of ordinary size is easy, but special arrangements must be made for handling the big ones.

====Usage notes====
{{m|en|rang|Rang}} and {{m|en|rung}} are incorrect for the past of {{m|en|ring}} in the sense of {{m|en|encircle}}, where {{m|en|ringed}} is used instead.

{{m|en|rung|Rung}} as a simple past is usually considered incorrect.
