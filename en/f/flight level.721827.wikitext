Flight Levels begin at FL180 or 18,000 feet above sea level.  Above this altitude all aircraft are required to be on an IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) Flight Plan.  Further all aircraft flying above 18,000 feet must set their altimeter to standard atmospheric pressure.  This means that the number in the Kollsman Window on the dial of the altimeter will read 29.92 inches of Mercury.  This assures that everyone in the system is referencing the same starting point when measuring height above the ground.  Below the Flight Levels everyone sets their altimeters to a local altimeter setting obtained by calling the closest nearby control tower (all towers have Calibrated Altimeters specifically for this purpose) or by setting the airport elevation on their altimeter before takeoff.
