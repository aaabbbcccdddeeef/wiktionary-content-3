*: ''Ought we not to collect for posterity the various ways in which very short times are denoted. Besides the one at the head, there are, — [[in no time]], [[in next to no time]], [[in less than no time]], [[in a trice]], [[in a jiffy]], [[in a brace of shakes]], [[before you can say Jack Robinson]], [[in a crack]], [[in the squeezing of a lemon]], [[in the doubling of your fist]], [[in the twinkling of an eye]], [[in a moment]], [[in an instant]], [[in a flash]].''
