====References====
* {{R:Online Etymology Dictionary}}
* For the sense ‘a short period of time’, the '''1858''' ''Notes and Queries'' of Martim de Albuquerque was consulted. From page 437 of the sixth volume of the second series, published in London by Bell & Dally, 186 Fleet Street, in 1858 :
*: ''Ought we not to collect for posterity the various ways in which very short times are denoted. Besides the one at the head, there are, — [[in no time]], [[in next to no time]], [[in less than no time]], [[in a trice]], [[in a jiffy]], [[in a brace of shakes]], [[before you can say Jack Robinson]], [[in a crack]], [[in the squeezing of a lemon]], [[in the doubling of your fist]], [[in the twinkling of an eye]], [[in a moment]], [[in an instant]], [[in a flash]].''

===Etymology 2===
From {{inh|en|enm|flasche}}, {{m|enm|flaske}}; compare {{cog|fro|flache}}, {{cog|fr|flaque}}, which is of {{cog|gem}} origin, akin to {{cog|dum|vlacke||an estuary, flats with stagnant pools}}.

====Noun====
{{en-noun}}

# A [[pool]].
#* '''a. 1646''', {{w|Jeremiah Burroughs}}, ''The Excellency of Holy Courage in Evil Times''
#*:their hearts lie lumpish as a Log that lies in a '''flash''' of water seven years together
# {{lb|en|engineering}} A [[reservoir]] and [[sluiceway]] beside a [[navigable]] [[stream]], just above a [[shoal]], so that the stream may pour in water as boats pass, and thus bear them over the shoal.
