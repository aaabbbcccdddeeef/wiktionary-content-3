Verb from {{inh|en|enm|fallen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|feallan||to fall, fail, decay, die, attack}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*fallan||to fall}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*fallaną||to fall}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*peh₃lH-}}.

Noun from {{inh|en|enm|fal}}, {{m|enm|fall}}, {{m|enm|falle}}, from {{inh|en|ang|feall}}, {{m|ang|ġefeall|t=a falling, fall}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*fallą}}, {{m|gem-pro|*fallaz|t=a fall, trap}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*(s)pōl-}}.

Sense of "autumn" is attested by the 1660s in [[England]] as a shortening of {{der|en|enm|-}} ''[[fall of the leaf]]'' (1540s), from the falling of leaves during this season. Along with ''autumn'', it mostly replaced the older name ''[[harvest]]'' as that name began to be associated strictly with the act of harvesting. Compare ''[[spring]]'', which began as a shortening of “spring of the leaf”.
