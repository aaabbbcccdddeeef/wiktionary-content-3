{{wikipedia}}

===Etymology 1===
Noun from {{inh|en|enm|fal}}, {{m|enm|fall}}, {{m|enm|falle}}, from {{inh|en|ang|feall}}, {{m|ang|ġefeall|t=a falling, fall}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*fallą}}, {{m|gem-pro|*fallaz|t=a fall, trap}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*(s)pōl-}}. Cognate with {{cog|nl|val}}, {{cog|de|Fall}}, {{cog|sv|fall}}, {{cog|is|fall}}.

Sense of "autumn" began in the 1660s in [[England]] as a shortening of {{der|en|enm|-}} ''[[fall of the leaf]]'' (1540s), from the falling of leaves during this season. Compare ''[[spring]]'', which began as a shortening of “spring of the leaf”.

Verb from {{inh|en|enm|fallen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|feallan||to fall, fail, decay, die, attack}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*fallaną||to fall}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*(s)pōl-}}. Cognate with {{cog|fy|falle||to fall}}, {{cog|nds|fallen||to fall}}, {{cog|nl|vallen||to fall}}, {{cog|de|fallen||to fall}}, {{cog|nb|falle||to fall}}, {{cog|nn|falla||to fall}}, {{cog|is|falla||to fall}}, {{cog|sq|fal||forgive, pray, salute, greet}}, {{cog|lt|pùlti||to attack, rush}}.
