===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|female}}, an alteration of Middle English {{m|enm|femele}}, {{m|enm|femel}}, from {{etyl|fro|en}} {{m|fro|femele}}, {{term|femelle||female|lang=fro}}, from {{etyl|ML.|en}} {{m|la|femella||a female}}, from {{etyl|la|en}} {{m|la|femella||a young female, a girl}}, diminutive of {{term|femina||a woman|lang=la}}. The English spelling and pronunciation were remodelled under the influence of {{m|en|male}}, which is not etymologically related. Contrast {{m|en|woman}}, which ''is'' etymologically built on {{m|en|man}}.
