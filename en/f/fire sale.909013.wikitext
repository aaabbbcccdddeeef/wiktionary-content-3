#A [[clearance]] [[sale]] at greatly reduced prices, often at losses.  Originally, a sale of product that had been damaged by fire or that could no longer be stored because the storage facility had been destroyed by fire necessitating immediate sale or loss of value.

#*:By the following year, Lehman’s enormous holdings in subprime loans were all but wiped out, and Bush was enlisted to see if he could engineer a '''fire sale''' of some of the bank’s empire of debt to the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.
