====Usage notes====
* The spelling ''[[focused]]'' is much more common in the US but also more common in the UK and Australia.
* It violates the UK spelling rule that calls for a double consonant whenever a short vowel sound precedes a suffix beginning with a vowel, (cf bonuses, octopuses) perhaps to avoid looking like ''[[cussed]]''.
* The Oxford English Dictionary describes the spelling ''focussed'' as irregular.
* The spelling ''focussed'' is a widely seen UK spelling but ''focused'', (''focuses'', ''focusing'') is more common in prestige publications.
* The spelling ''focussed'' is nowadays more common in Canada and New Zealand than in the UK.
