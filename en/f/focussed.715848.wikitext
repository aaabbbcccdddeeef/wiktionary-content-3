====Usage notes====
* The spelling ''[[focused]]'' is much more common in the US but also more common in the UK and Australia. 
* It violates the UK spelling rule that calls for a double consonant whenever a short vowel sound precedes a suffix beginning with a vowel, perhaps to avoid looking like ''[[cussed]]''. 
* In UK English, such a consonant must traditionally be doubled even when the short preceding vowel sound is not stressed, e.g. ''travelled'', where US spelling traditionally accepts only ''traveled'' (but ''travelled'' is sometimes seen and especially ''programmed'' is very common). Such consonants are traditionally doubled according to US English spelling rules only when stressed, e.g. ''called'', ''referred''. 
* So the spelling ''focussed'' is the traditional UK spelling and ''focused'' (and ''focusing'') is an exception but so common that the online Cambridge and Oxford dictionaries list it first. The usually non-prescriptive Longman dictionary surprisingly gives only the traditional UK spelling and claims that ''focused'' is only US English. 
* The traditional UK spelling ''focussed'' is nowadays more common in Canada and New Zealand than in the UK.
