====Usage notes====
* The spelling ''[[focused]]'' is much more common in the US but also more common in the UK and Australia.
* ''Focussed'' violates the UK spelling rule that calls for a doubling of a final unsupported consonant when a suffix beginning with a vowel is appended, only when the final vowel is both short and accented, (cf no doubling in ''opened'', ''covered'', ''bonuses'', ''octopuses''), except when the final letter is L, which doubles also when the syllable is unaccented (cf ''travelled'').
* The Oxford English Dictionary describes the spelling ''focussed'' as irregular.
* The spelling ''focussed'' is a widely seen UK spelling but ''focused'', (''focuses'', ''focusing'') is more common in prestige publications.
* The spelling ''focussed'' is nowadays more common in Canada and New Zealand than in the UK.
