# A crime committed against oneself, in particular suicide
#* {{quote-text|en|year=1776|author=Thomas Paine|title=Common Sense - Chapter 1 - Page 7-8|passage=How came the king by a power which the people are afraid to trust, and always obliged to check? Such a power could not be the gift of a wise people, neither can any power, which needs checking, be from God; yet the provision, which the constitution makes, supposes such a power to exist. But the provision is unequal to the task; the means either cannot or will not accomplish the end, and the whole affair is a '''felo de se'''; for as the greater weight will always carry up the less, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to know which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that will govern; and though the others, or a part of them, may clog, or, as the phrase is, check the rapidity of its motion, yet so long as they cannot stop it, their endeavors will be ineffectual; the first moving power will at last have its way, and what it wants in speed is supplied by time.}}
#* '''1779''', {{w|Richard Brinsley Sheridan}}, ''{{w|The Critic (play)|The Critic: or, A Tragedy Rehearsed}}'':
#*: Sneer. And you bore all with patience, I make no doubt?<br>Puff. Why, yes—tho’ I made ſome occaſional attempts at '''''felo de ſe'''''; but as I did not find thoſe ''raſh actions'' anſwer, I left off killing myſelf very ſoon.
#* '''1822''', {{w|Lord Byron}}, ''{{w|The Vision of Judgement}}'', stanza 94:
#*: The Varlet was not an ill-favoured knave;<br>A good deal like a Vulture in the face<br>With a hook nose and a Hawk’s eye which gave<br>A smart & sharper-looking sort of grace<br>To his whole aspect, which though rather grave<br>Was by no means so ugly as his case,<br>But that indeed was hopeless as can be—<br>Quite a poetic '''felony “''de se''.”'''—
