===Etymology===
[[fuck]] + [[-eth]]

Fucketh is used by angry British kings to express anger at foolish, unworthy servants. 

'''Example''': The King orders a servant to retrieve water. The servant trips over a statue, the statue collapses into a pile of whatever, and the waters spills and stains the satin rug. The King yells: "Fucketh you! Off with his head!"

(1 hour later)

CHOP!

The King: "Hehehe."
