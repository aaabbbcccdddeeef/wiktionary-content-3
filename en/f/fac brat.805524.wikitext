'''Fac brat''' is a slang term referring to the child of a faculty member at a high school, university, or college. In some cases of admission, fac brats are given priority over equally qualified students  at private educational institutions.[[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/education/edlife/EDPREP.html]]
