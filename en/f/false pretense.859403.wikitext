#: <!--This is DAMN long. Is it a quote or something?-->''I hear you want to go back to middle school because you say your life is too tough where you are now. Even if you could somehow manage to give yourself make-up and plastic surgery to LOOK like a middle-schooler, if you give them a false name, birth date, and so forth, you'll be enrolling there under '''false pretenses'''.
