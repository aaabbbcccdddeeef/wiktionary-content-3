:''A '''familicide''' is a multiple-victim homicide incident in which the killer's spouse and one or more children are slain.... Familicides were almost exclusively perpetrated by men, unlike other spouse-killings and other filicides. Half the familicidal men killed themselves as well, a much higher rate of suicide than among other [[uxoricidal]] or [[filicidal]] men.''

:''Investigators say Kevin Morrissey, 51, was overwhelmed by money problems when he parked his car in Tilden Park and killed his two children, his wife and then himself Monday evening. Experts on "'''familicide'''" -- the term used by psychologists and criminologists to describe the killing of one's entire family and oneself -- said Morrissey fit the profile.''
