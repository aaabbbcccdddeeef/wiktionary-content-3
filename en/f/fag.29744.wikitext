=====Usage notes=====
When used in North America to describe a homosexual male, ''fag'' can be a very offensive and vulgar term, but not as offensive and vulgar as ''faggot''. However, the term may be used in an affectionate and good-natured manner among homosexual men themselves.  In particular, the derived terms ''[[fag hag]]'' and ''[[fag stag]]'' ''may'' still be offensive, but are less offensive assumed to be so by default, and can often be the primary terms for "straight female friend of gay men" and "straight male friend of gay men" respectively.

As LGBT people have become more socially mainstreamed in many societies, the term ''fag'' has also come to mean a homosexual male who is particularly conspicuous, such that they cannot or will not pass for [[straight-acting]].  This may possibly imply effeminacy, flamboyance or homoerotic machismo, but need not necessarily imply any of these things so long the personality is ''conspicuously'' homosexual.  This definition of ''fag'' can sometimes have a derogatory connotation within the gay community because of the politics of straight-acting in mainstream society, and the sociopolitical question of whether gay men must be seen as straight-acting to enjoy mainstream tolerance.  But there are also neutral and affectionate uses of this definition, chiefly among friends and allies in the context of accepting a non-straight-acting personality as benign, particularly if it is sincere and unpretentious.
