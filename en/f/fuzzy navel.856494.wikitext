===Etymology===
There are several theories about when and where the drink was invented, but in any case it gets its name from the ''fuzz'' of the peach and the ''navel'' orange used to make it.

===Noun===
{{en-noun|~}}

# A [[cocktail]] ([[mixed drink]]), usually [[made]] with [[peach]] [[schnapps]] and [[orange]] [[juice]], though sometimes made with lemonade instead.

# {{lb|en|in compounds}} A drink or food (of a specified type) which imitates this cocktail by featuring peach and orange as central flavours (with or without alcohol).
#: '''''fuzzy navel''' milkshake'', '''''fuzzy navel''' cake'', '''''fuzzy navel''' pie''<!--look at the recipes for all of these things -- many don't include alcohol, so it's clear they're reference the orange and peach ''flavours'' of the cocktail, not just putting the cocktail itself into a pie-->
