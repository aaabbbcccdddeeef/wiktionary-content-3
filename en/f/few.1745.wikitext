====Usage notes====
* {{term||Few}} is used with plural nouns only; its synonymous counterpart {{term|little}} is used with [[Appendix:Glossary#uncountable|uncountable]] nouns.
* Although indefinite in nature, a few is usually more than two (two often being referred to as "a couple of"), and less than "several". If the sample population is say between 5 and 20, a few would mean three or four, but no more than this. However, if the population sample size were in the millions, "a few" could refer to several hundred items. In other words, ''few'' in this context means ''a very very small percentage'' but way over the 3 or 4 usually ascribed to it its use with much much smaller numbers.
: {{term||Few}} is grammatically affirmative but semantically negative, and it can [[license]] [[negative polarity item]]s. For example, ''[[lift a finger]]'' usually cannot be used in affirmative sentences, but can be used in sentences with {{term||few}}.
*: ''He didn't lift a finger to help us.''
*: *''He lifted a finger to help us.'' (ungrammatical)
*: '''''Few''' people lifted a finger to help us.''
*: *''A few people lifted a finger to help us.'' (ungrammatical)
*: *''Fewer people lifted a finger to help us.'' (ungrammatical)
