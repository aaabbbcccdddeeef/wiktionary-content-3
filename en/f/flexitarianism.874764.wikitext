'''Flexitarianism''' is the practice of being "flexible" about the degree to which one is actually a [[vegetarian]]. A "flexitarian" might make only vegetarian dishes at home, but eat dishes including [[meat]] at the home of family or friends. Or, they may try to stick to a vegetarian diet but are often unsuccessful because they enjoy non-vegetarian foods. In [[2003]], the [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''flexitarian'' as the year's most useful word, and defined it as "a vegetarian who occasionally eats meat." 

None of the vegetarian organizations recognize this as a category of vegetarian, and it is generally viewed as being as paradoxical as the word "[[Pesco/pollo_vegetarianism#Terminology|pescetarian]]".  



==Origin of term==
The earliest known use of the term "flexitarian" occurred in the [[October 17]], [[1992]] issue of the ''Austin American-Statesman''. In this issue, reporter Linda Anthony wrote an article titled, "Acorn serves up 'flexitarian fare'". The article discussed the recent opening of the new Acorn Caf√© and stated that owner Helga Morath calls her fare "flexitarian".
