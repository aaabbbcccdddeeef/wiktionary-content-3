'''Flexitarianism''' is a term used in the United States to describe the practice of eating mainly [[vegetarian food]], but making occasional exceptions for social, pragmatic, cultural, or [[nutrition]]al reasons. There is a wide range in the circumstances and outer boundaries of their dietary practices, which resist easy classification.<ref>{{cite web | title = Are you a 'flexitarian?' | publisher = The Associated Press | date = [[2004-03-16]] | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4541605/ | accessdate = 2007-12-03 }}</ref> The term '''semi-vegetarianism''' is used to convey roughly the same meaning as flexitarianism.

In [[2003]], the [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''flexitarian'' as the year's most useful word and defined it as "a vegetarian who occasionally eats meat".<ref>{{cite web | title = 2003 Words of the Year | publisher = American Dialect Society | date = [[2007-01-13]] | url = http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/2003_words_of_the_yea/ | accessdate = 2007-12-03 }}</ref>

==Origin of term==
The earliest known use of the term "flexitarian" occurred in the [[October 17]], [[1992]], issue of the ''Austin American-Statesman''. In this issue, reporter [[Linda Anthony]] wrote an article titled, "Acorn serves up 'flexitarian fare'". The article discussed the recent opening of the new [[Acorn Caf√©]] and stated that owner [[Helga Morath]] calls her fare "flexitarian".
