'''Flexitarianism''' (or '''semi-vegetarianism''') is a term used in the United States to describe the practice of eating mainly [[vegetarian food]], but making occasional exceptions for social, pragmatic, or [[nutrition]]al reasons. They may eat meat and/or other animal products sometimes. For example, a flexitarian might make only vegetarian dishes at home, but eat dishes including [[meat]] or [[fish]] at the home of family or friends.  There is a wide range in the circumstances and outer boundaries of their dietary practices, which resist easy classification.

In [[2003]], the [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''flexitarian'' as the year's most useful word and defined it as "a vegetarian who occasionally eats meat". Use of the word “flexitarian” has become wide spread, showing up in newspaper articles and “almost vegetarian” blogs.

None of the vegetarian organizations recognize "semi-vegetarianism" as a category of [[vegetarianism]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}, nor do people who partake in diets such as [[pescetarianism]] and [[pollotarianism]] accept the term "semi-vegetarian" to describe their diets. The term is largely a media based phenomenon. Many who partake in such diets consider them entirely independent diets and do not want to be associated with vegetarians{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. 

==Origin of term==
The earliest known use of the term "flexitarian" occurred in the [[October 17]], [[1992]] issue of the ''Austin American-Statesman''. In this issue, reporter Linda Anthony wrote an article titled, "Acorn serves up 'flexitarian fare'". The article discussed the recent opening of the new Acorn Café and stated that owner Helga Morath calls her fare "flexitarian".

It should be noted that while the term itself is useful, it encompasses a very broad range of possibilities.  Therefore, there is a basis for caution in terms of what type of flexibility is expected by any individual who identifies with it.
