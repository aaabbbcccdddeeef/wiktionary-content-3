'''Flexitarianism''' (or '''semi-vegetarianism''') is the practice of eating mainly [[vegetarian food]], but making occasional exceptions for social, pragmatic, or nutritional reasons. They will eat meat and other animal products sometimes. For example, a flexitarian might make only vegetarian dishes at home, but eat dishes including [[meat]] at the home of family or friends.

In [[2003]], the [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''flexitarian'' as the year's most useful word and defined it as "a vegetarian who occasionally eats meat". 

None of the vegetarian organizations recognize "semi-vegetarianism" as a category of [[vegetarianism]], and it is viewed by many vegetarians as being paradoxical, like the terms "[[pescetarianism|pesco-vegetarianism]]" and "[[pollotarianism|pollo-vegetarianism]]", since per definition a vegetarian diet does not include the flesh of animals.   

==Origin of term==
The earliest known use of the term "flexitarian" occurred in the [[October 17]], [[1992]] issue of the ''Austin American-Statesman''. In this issue, reporter Linda Anthony wrote an article titled, "Acorn serves up 'flexitarian fare'". The article discussed the recent opening of the new Acorn Caf√© and stated that owner Helga Morath calls her fare "flexitarian".
