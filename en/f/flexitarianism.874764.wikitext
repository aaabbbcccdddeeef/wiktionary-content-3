'''Flexitarianism''' is the practice of being "flexible" about the degree to which one is actually a [[vegetarian]]. A "flexitarian" might make only vegetarian dishes at home, but eat dishes including [[meat]] at the home of family or friends. In [[2003]], the [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''flexitarian'' as the year's most useful word, and defined it as "a vegetarian who occasionally eats meat." 

None of the vegetarian organizations recognize this as a category of vegetarian, and it is generally viewed as being as paradoxical as the word "[[Pesco/pollo_vegetarianism#Terminology|pescetarian]]".  

==Why Flexitarianism==
{{sources}}
People choose to follow flexitarianism for a variety of reasons.

* They may consider a vegetarian diet to be healthier, but enjoy eating meat.
* They may prefer a vegetarian diet, but would not restrict themselves from eating if vegetarian options are not available.
* They may not be ethically opposed to eating meat, but find a vegetarian diet to be less expensive.
* Other members of their household might be vegetarian and a flexitarian diet is more convenient.
* They may believe vegetarian food conserves water and land resources and thus feeds more people.
* Some, like [[Freeganism|freegans]], believe that wasting already-cooked food does more damage than eating it.
* They may believe it is rude to refuse a meal cooked by a friend, even if it contains meat.
* They may oppose the poor conditions or environmental consequences of certain practices in [[animal husbandry]], and hence will only eat what they consider "ethical meat". 
* They may believe in minimising their environmental footprint by eating less meat.
* They may be unwilling to invest in the sanitation needed for keeping meat safe to eat.
* They may favor a vegetarian diet, but also need to supplement it with added protein for health reasons.
* Strict Diets can be very unhealthy. Diets have an 80% failure rate. Balance is an important value.

==Origin of term==
The earliest known use of the term "flexitarian" occurred in the [[October 17]], [[1992]] issue of the ''Austin American-Statesman''. In this issue, reporter Linda Anthony wrote an article titled, "Acorn serves up 'flexitarian fare'". The article discussed the recent opening of the new Acorn Caf√© and stated that owner Helga Morath calls her fare "flexitarian".
