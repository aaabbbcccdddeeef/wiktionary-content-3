===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[future]] [[tense]]}}

# {{grammar}} The [[tense]] or time form of a verb used to refer to an event or occurrence that has not yet happened or is expected to happen in the [[future]].

====Usage notes====
The future tense in English is indicated with [[compound verb]]s made up of a main verb plus [[auxiliary verb]]s or [[helper]] verbs.

The simple future tense is made up of ''shall'' plus the infinitive (without "to") in the first person, and ''will'' plus the infinitive in the second and third persons.
: I shall go, we shall go
: You will go
: He, she, it, they will go

The [[emphatic future tense]] reverses the auxiliary verbs:
: I will go, we will go
: You shall go
: He, she, it, they shall go

Another form uses the [[progressive]] form of ''go'' plus the infinitive:
: I am going to walk, we are going to walk
: You are going to walk
: He, she, it is going to walk, they are going to walk

Besides these examples, there are other [[periphrastic]] forms to indicate future tense.
