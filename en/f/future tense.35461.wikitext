===Noun===
'''[[future]] [[tense]]''' (''plural:'' '''future tenses''')

# {{grammar}}: the [[tense]] or time form of a verb used to refer to an event or occurrence that has not yet happened or is expected to happen in the [[future]].

===Usage notes===
The future tense in English is indicated with [[compound verb]]s made up of a main verb plus [[auxiliary verb]]s or [[helper]] verbs.

The simple future tense is made up of ''shall'' plus the infinitive (without "to") in the first person, and ''will'' plus the infinitive in the second and third persons.
:I shall go, we shall go
:You will go
:He, she, it, they will go

The [[emphatic future tense]] reverses the auxiliary verbs:
:I will go, we will go
:You shall go
:He, she, it, they shall go

Another form uses the [[progressive]] form of ''go'' plus the infinitive:
:I am going to walk, we are going to walk
:You are going to walk
:He, she, it is going to walk, they are going to walk

Besides these examples, there are other [[periphrastic]] forms to indicate future tense.
