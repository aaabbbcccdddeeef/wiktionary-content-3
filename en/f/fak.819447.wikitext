'''Fak''' is a [[colloquial]] expression used in lieu of '[[Fuck]]'. It has roots to [[1970s]] [[European]] [[Punk Rock]] culture. Though falling out of most western [[vernacular]], the term is occasionally used by people who self idenify as Punk Rock, and occasionally, British television.
==Examples==
Fak off! <BR>
Go fak yourself.<BR>
Get the fak out.<BR><BR>
