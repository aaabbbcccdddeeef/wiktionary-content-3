===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*preyH-}}
Borrowed from {{bor|en|es|filibustero||[[pirate]]}}, from {{der|en|fr|flibustier}}, ultimately from {{der|en|nl|vrijbuiter||[[freebooter]]}}, from {{m|nl|vrij||[[free]]}} + {{m|nl|buit||[[booty]]}} + {{m|nl|-er||agent}}. The alteration in the first syllable in French is due to the word's being somewhat conflated with {{m|nl|vlieboot||light, flat-bottomed cargo vessel with two or three masts}} when it was borrowed into French or another language from Dutch. The word is cognate and analogous to {{cog|en|freebooter}}.
