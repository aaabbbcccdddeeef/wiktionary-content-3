|title={{w|Thornhill v. Alabama}}
|publisher={{w|Supreme Court of the United States}}
|year=1940|passage=The '''freedom of speech''' and of the press, which are secured by the First Amendment against abridgment by the United States, are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a state. The safeguarding of these rights to the ends that men may speak as they think on matters vital to them and that falsehoods may be exposed through the processes of education and discussion is essential to free government. Those who won our independence had confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning and communication of ideas to discover and spread political and economic truth.|page={{w|Case citation|310 U.S. 88 }}

When the Pentagon Papers landed on the doorstep of ''The New York Times'', the newspaper was able to publish under the First Amendment's guarantees of '''freedom of speech''', and to make a strong argument in court that publication was in the public interest. ... the amplification inherent in the combination of the Net's high-speed communications and the size of the available population has greatly changed the balance of power.}}
