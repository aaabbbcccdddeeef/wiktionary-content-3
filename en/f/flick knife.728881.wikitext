# {{lb|en|British}} A type of [[knife]] which has the blade mounted on a pivot so that it can fold back sideways into the handle when not in use, but can flick out straight, when required. Such a knife is almost never used as a weapon. The primary type of knife used in edged weapon assaults is a large kitchen knife.
