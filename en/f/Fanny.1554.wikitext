|passage=They listened to the sound of '''Fanny’s''' retreating footsteps. ‘Well, well!’ said Marcus. ‘Oh, take no notice Jess. You know what our Frances Maud is like! It’s nothing to cry about!’ To her humiliation Jessamy found there were tears trickling down her cheeks. ‘Always getting worked up about something, '''Fanny''' is.’<br />– page 105:<br />As she did so '''Fanny''' put down her book , stood up and stretched her arms, and at once Jessamy noticed a difference. It was the same '''Fanny''' but not the '''Fanny''' who climbed trees and tore her frock playing in the garden. It was as though a young lady film had settled over her, neatening her unruly hair, which was tied back with a large black bow, and primly composing her small mouth.
