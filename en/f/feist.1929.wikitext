===Alternative forms===
* {{l|en|fist}}, {{l|en|fice}}

===Etymology===
Earliest sense is “fart”, and later “stink” as abbreviation for ''[[fysting]] [[cur]]'' “stinking dog” (1520s). From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|fysten}} (mid-15th century), from {{etyl|ang|-}}. Cognates with {{cog|dum|veest}} and {{cog|nl|vijst}}. Possibly from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*fistiz||a fart}}, presumably from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*pesd-}}, though this is disputed.<ref>{{R:Online_Etymology_Dictionary}}</ref>

One explanation for the association of farting with small dogs is given in an 1811 slang dictionary, which suggests that the dogs were blamed for farting, specifically defining {{m|en|fice}} as “a small windy escape backwards, more obvious to the nose than ears; frequently by old ladies charged on their lap-dogs.”<ref>Classic 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</ref>

Cognate terms include Danish {{m|da|fise||to blow, to fart}} and obsolete Middle English {{m|enm|askefise||bellows|lit=fire-blower, ash-blower}}, from {{etyl|non|-}}; originally “a term of reproach among northern nations for an unwarlike fellow who stayed at home in the chimney corner”.<ref>OED</ref>
