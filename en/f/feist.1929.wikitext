* [[fist]]

===Etymology===
Earliest sense is “fart”, and later “stink”. Sense of dog is 1805 American English, from earlier forms {{term|fice|lang=en}} and {{term|fist|lang=en}}, as abbreviation for ''[[fysting]] [[curre]]'' “stinking [[cur]]” (1520s), from {{etyl|enm|en}} {{term|fysten|lang=enm}}, {{term|fisten||fart, break wind|lang=enm}} (mid-15th century) (related to {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term|fisting||stink|lang=ang}}). Old English term is from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*fistiz-||a fart}}, presumably from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*pezd-}}, though this is disputed.<ref>{{R:Online_Etymology_Dictionary}}</ref>

One explanation for the association of farting with small dogs is given in an 1811 slang dictionary, which suggests that the dogs were blamed for farting, specifically defining {{term|fice|lang=en}} as “a small windy escape backwards, more obvious to the nose than ears; frequently by old ladies charged on their lap-dogs.”<ref>Classic 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</ref>

Cognate terms include Danish {{term|fise||to blow, to fart|lang=da}} and obsolete Middle English {{term|askefise||bellows|lit=fire-blower, ash-blower|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|non|-}}; originally “a term of reproach among northern nations for an unwarlike fellow who stayed at home in the chimney corner”.<ref>OED</ref>
