===Notes===
Often cited as an example of the longest non-technical word in the English language.

The Oxford dictionary classes it 'humorous'

===Creation===
Created by scholars at Eton by adding numerous words together.

# flocci is from the Latin [[floccus]], which means "fleece" and is related to the verb floccipendo which means, literally, "to give the value of a bit of fleece" or "to take lightly."
# [[nauci]] is a word meaning "few" or "almost nothing."
# [[nihil]], like in anihilation, is the Latin word for "nothing."
# pili is the plural form of the word [[pilus]], the Latin word for "small hair," but in this case meaning "trifle."
# fica is from the verb [[facio]] meaning "to do" or "to make."
# tion is a standard English nominalization form.
