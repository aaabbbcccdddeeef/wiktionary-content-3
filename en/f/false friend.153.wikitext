{{en-noun|sg=[[false]] [[friend]]}}

# {{idiom}} A word in a foreign language bearing a deceptive resemblance to a word in one's own language. Mistranslating such words carelessly can cause serious problems. 

===Usage notes===
For example:
*The French ''[[nous]] [[demandons]]'' means "we [[ask]]", but sounds like "we [[demand]]", which can turn negotiation into confrontation.
*The Spanish word ''[[embarazada]]'' means "[[pregnant]]", not "[[embarrassed]]" &mdash; "Estoy embarazada" means "I am pregnant," not "I am embarrassed".
*The German word ''[[will]]'' ([[want]]) is not a future tense marker &mdash; "Ich will gehen" means "I want to go," not "I will go".
*The Italian word ''[[triviale]]'' ([[vulgar]]) is written almost like ''[[trivial]]'' but the two words share only a common Latin root (trivium in Latin is a crossroad) no longer any meaning; "Questo e' triviale" means "This is in bad taste" not "This is obvious".
