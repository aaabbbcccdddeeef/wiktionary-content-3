==Romanian==

===Etymology===
From {{inh|ro|la|facere}}, present active infinitive of {{m|la|faciō}}<ref>http://www.dex.ro/face</ref>, from {{inh|ro|itc-pro|*fakiō}}, from {{inh|ro|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-||to put, place, set}}. The verb's original past participle was {{m|ro|fapt}}, from {{m|la|factum}}, but was changed and replaced several centuries ago. An alternative third-person simple perfect, ''fece'', from {{m|la|fecit}}, was also found in some dialects.<ref>https://archive.org/details/grundrissderroma00gruoft</ref> The meaning ''"to cost"'' is likely a calque of [[Greek]] {{m|el|κάνω}}.
