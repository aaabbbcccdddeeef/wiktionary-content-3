This is when a man wears nothing under a pair of trousers.

One gay man i asked said
"I heard about free balling when i was 16, i never worn boxers since, its SO nice"

And many others agree with him.
Its associated with gays but many straight guys have found themselves freeballing due to a lack of clean undies to wear. It seems to be an erotic experience and most guys who do it find them selves with an erection not long into it. Thus, the gay interest.
