===Etymology===
Uncertain, though almost certainly Germanic. Though not seen in print until the 1500s, a personal name ''John Le Fucker'' recorded in 1278 suggests that it had been around a lot longer.  Compare dialectal Norwegian [[fukka]] ‘fuck’, Swedish ''[[focka]]'' (earlier, "fuck", nowadays "fire from work") and Dutch ''[[fokken]]'' ‘to breed’. The Indo-European origins are largely hypothetical, and are based on a common root meaning "to strike" (the source of Latin ''[[pugnus]]'' "fist" among many others throughout the Indo-European languages). A range of folk-etymological acronyms have been suggested ('''F'''ornication '''U'''nder '''C'''onsent of the '''K'''ing, '''F'''or '''U'''nlawful '''C'''arnal '''K'''nowledge), all equally unsubstantiated.

The obscenity fuck is a very old word and has been considered shocking from the first, though it is seen in print much more often now than in the past. Its first known occurrence, in code because of its unacceptability, is in a poem composed in a mixture of Latin and English sometime before 1500. The poem, which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge, England, takes its title, “Flen flyys,” from the first words of its opening line, “Flen, flyys, and freris,” that is, “fleas, flies, and friars.” The line that contains fuck reads “Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk.” The Latin words “Non sunt in coeli, quia,” mean “they [the friars] are not in heaven, since.” The code “gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk” is easily broken by simply substituting the preceding letter in the alphabet, keeping in mind differences in the alphabet and in spelling between then and now: 'i' was then used for both 'i' and 'j'; 'v' was used for both 'u' and 'v'; and 'vv' was used for 'w'. This yields “fvccant [a fake Latin form] vvivys of heli.” The whole thus reads in translation: “They are not in heaven because they fuck wives of Ely [a town near Cambridge].”

== Why It Is Fun To Say ==

The word "fuck", if you will, is a word that means hatred, pleasure, pain, and several other emotions. It is used on many, many occasions because it desribes all these feelings and it rolls off the tongue real well. Some people prefer not to hear it, and some people can not stop saying the word because it is "flectular."
