You can ''emphasize text'' by putting two
apostrophes on each side. Three apostrophes
will emphasize it '''strongly'''. Five
apostrophes is '''''even stronger'''''.
A single newline
has no effect
on the layout.

But an empty line
starts a new paragraph.
You can break lines<br>
without starting a new paragraph.<br>
Please use this sparingly.
You can use <b>HTML tags</b>, too, if you
want. Some useful ways to use HTML:

Put text in a <tt>typewriter font</tt>.
The same font is generally used for
<code>computer code</code>.

<strike>Strike out</strike> or
<u>underline</u> text, or write it
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">
in small caps</span>.

Superscripts and subscripts:
x<sup>2</sup>, x<sub>2</sub>

Invisible comments that only appear while editing the page.
<!-- Note to editors: blah blah blah. -->
Comments should usually go on the talk page, though.
== Section headings ==

Headings organize your writing into sections.
The Wiki software can automatically generate
a table of contents from them.

=== Subsection ===

Using more equals signs creates a subsection.

==== A smaller subsection ====

Don't skip levels, like from two to four equals signs.
Start with two equals signs; don't use single equals signs.
* ''Unordered lists'' are easy to do:
** Start every line with a star.
*** More stars indicate a deeper level.
*A newline
*in a list  
marks the end of the list.
*Of course you can start again.
# Numbered lists are also good:
## Very organized
## Easy to follow
A newline marks the end of the list.
#New numbering starts with 1.
* You can even do mixed lists
*# and nest them
*#* or break lines<br>in lists.
Another kind of list is a '''definition list''':
; word : definition of the word
; longer phrase 
: phrase defined
:A colon indents a line or paragraph.
A newline after that starts a new paragraph.
::This is often used for discussion on talk pages.
You can make horizontal dividing lines
to separate text.
----
But you should usually use sections instead,
so that they go in the table of contents.
Here's a link to a page named [[Official position]].
You can even say [[official position]]s
and the link will show up correctly.

You can put formatting around a link.
Example: ''[[Wikipedia]]''.

The ''first letter'' will automatically be capitalized,
so [[wikipedia]] is the same as [[Wikipedia]].
Capitalization matters after the first letter.

[[Unwritten article]] is a page that doesn't exist
yet. You can create it by clicking on the link.
You can link to a page section by its title:

*[[List of cities by country#Morocco]].
*[[List of cities by country#Sealand]].

If multiple sections have the same title, add
a number. [[#Example section 3]] goes to the
third section named "Example section".
You can make a link point to a different place
with a [[Help:Piped link|piped link]]. Put the link
target first, then the pipe character "|", then
the link text.

*[[Help:Link|About Links]]
*[[List of cities by country#Morocco|
Cities in Morocco]]
