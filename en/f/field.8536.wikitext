====Usage notes====
In the mathematical sense, some languages, such as French, use a term that literally means "[[body]]". This denotes a [[division ring]] or [[skew field]], not necessarily [[commutative]]. If it is clear from context that the [[quaternion]]s and similar division rings are irrelevant, or that all division rings being considered are finite and therefore fields, this difference is ignored.

===Verb===
