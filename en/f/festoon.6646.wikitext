#* '''2005''', Judith Martin, ''Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior'', Norton, p.&nbsp;804:
#*: A mysterious woman who shows up at a funeral more droopily '''festooned''' in black than the widow is making what is known as a fashion statement.

#*: Some teachers '''festoon''' every spare inch of wall with vocabulary choices or maths techniques to use, which look great at first, but to some children might appear quite daunting. You'll probably see unfamiliar acronyms such as Walt (We Are Learning To). Be sure to ask what they stand for and how they are used in practice.

This means they don't rely on their hosts for all their needs: Instead, they harvest the sun's energy to make some sugars for themselves. Nonetheless, if you're a tree, you don't want to be '''festooned''' with them. Two or three shouldn't be a problem, but dozens of mistletoes can lead to water stress, insect infestation or even death.}}
