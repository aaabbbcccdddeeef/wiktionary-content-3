===Etymology===
Since c. 1943 ''Skunk Works'' was the nickname of {{w|Lockheed}} Advanced Development Projects, eventually gaining official recognition. The name is derived from a mysterious, foul-smelling "skonk oil"-brewing facility called the ''Skonk Works'' in the comic strip ''L'il Abner'' by {{w|Al Capp}}.<!--As one source reports:
[L]egend goes that one of Lockheed's engineers asked, "What the heck is Kelly [a Lockheed engineer] doing in there?" "Oh, he's stirring up some kind of brew" was the answer. This brought to mind [[w:Al Capp|Al Capp's]] popular comic strip, [[w:Li'l Abner|Li'l Abner]] and the hairy Indian who regularly stirred up the brew, throwing in skunks, old shoes, and other likely material to make his 'kickapoo joy juice. Thus, the skunk works was born and named.-George Tesar, ''Strategic Technology Management: Building Bridges Between Sciences'' (2003) p. 117. [Not exactly authoritative; also wrong about 'kickapoo joy juice being the product]-->
