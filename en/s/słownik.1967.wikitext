====Usage notes====
Słownik is a Polish word which is usually translated as “dictionary”, but its usage is much wider than that. Almost anything that contains definitions of words is a “słownik”.

While generally in Polish an [[encyklopedia]] is not usually considered to be a słownik,
specialist [[encyklopedia]]s often are thus called as in “Słownik Chemiczny”. This particular meaning is similar to [[glossary]] or [[lexicon]] (“Lexicon of Chemistry”).

The second meaning of słownik is [[vocabulary]] employed by or known to an individual (see one of the meanings of [[lexicon]]). This is a short and not elegant form of the word ''[[słownictwo]]''.
