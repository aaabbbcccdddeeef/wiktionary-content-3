===Noun===
'''słownik'''
# [[dictionary]]

===Usage notes===
Słownik is a [[Polish language|Polish]] word which is usually translated as "dictionary", but it's usage is much wider than that. Almost anything that contains definitions of words is a "słownik".

While generally in Polish an [[encyklopedia]] is not usually considered to be a słownik,
specialist [[encyklopedia|encyklopedias]] often are thus called as in "Słownik Chemiczny". This particular meaning is similar to [[glossary]] or [[lexicon]] ("Lexicon of Chemistry").

The second meaning of słownik is [[vocabulary]] employed by or known to an individual (see one of the meanings of [[lexicon]]). This is a short and not elegant form of the word słownictwo.
