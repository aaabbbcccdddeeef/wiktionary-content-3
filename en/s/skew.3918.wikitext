===Etymology 1===
The {{glossary|verb}} is derived from {{inh|en|enm|skeuen}}, {{m|enm|skewe}}, {{m|enm|skewen|t=to run at an angle or obliquely; to escape}}, from {{der|en|ONF.|escuer}}{{nb...|eskieuer, eskiuer, eskiuwer, eskuer|otherforms=1}}, variants of {{der|en|fro|eschuer}}, {{m|fro|eschever}}, {{m|fro|eschiver|t=to escape, flee; to avoid}} (modern {{cog|fr|esquiver|t=to dodge (a blow), duck; to elude, evade; to slip away; to sidestep}}),<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=skeuen|pos=''v.''(2)|noformat=yes|id=MED40664}}</ref><ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=''v.{{sup|2}}''|noformat=yes|id=180793|date=1911|nodot=1}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=v}}</ref> from {{der|en|frk|*skiuhan|t=to dread; to avoid, shun}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*skiuhijaną|t=to frighten}}. The English word is cognate with {{cog|da|skæv|t=crooked, slanting; skew, wry}}, {{cog|no|skjev|t=crooked, lopsided; oblique, slanting; distorted}}, {{cog|stq|skeeuw|t=aslant, slanting; oblique; awry}}, and is a {{doublet|en|eschew|nocap=1}}.

The {{glossary|adjective}} and {{glossary|adverb}} are probably derived from the verb and/or from {{m|en|askew}},<ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=adj.'' and ''adv|id=180791|date=1911|nodot=1}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=adj}}</ref> and the {{glossary|noun}} is derived from either the adjective or the verb.<ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=''n.{{sup|3}}''|noformat=yes|id=180785|date=1911|nodot=1}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=n}}</ref>

[...] One signal, the clock, needs to be distributed to all parts of a digital circuit to synchronize its action. The necessarily long path results in the danger of the clock signal arriving at the wrong time (''clock '''skew'''''), limiting the maximum frequency at which the circuit may be clocked.}}

A negative '''skew''' suggests that the left half of the normal distribution (the left side of the mean) is twisted in such a way that the prospect of achieving negative returns is superior to that of achieving large positive returns. [...] When dealing with '''skew''', traders strive to resolve how frequently in the trading time horizon they will obtain negative returns rather than positive returns. A '''skew''' demonstrates the relationship between the movement of an underlying asset and its volatility.}}
