Snowsqualls or lake effect snow is the result of cold air blowing over a relatively warm body of water. As the air moves over the water it picks up heat and moisture. When it gets to the colder land it is forced to drop this moisture in the form of snow. The squalls can carry strong winds and produce significant accumulations of snow, reducing visibility and making roads slippery. Snowsqualls are typically very localized phenomena. 

A squall is the rapid onset of strong winds with speeds increasing to at least 16 knots and sustained at 22 knots or more for a minimum of one minute.
