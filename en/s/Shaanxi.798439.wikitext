===Etymology===
From {{etyl|cmn|en}} {{zh-l|陝西}}. By regular [[Hanyu Pinyin]] rules, if tone marks are not written, both Shaanxi and [[Shanxi]], a province east of Shaanxi, should be spelled "Shanxi"; the difference is in tone: [[Shānxī]] and [[Shǎnxī]]. To make the difference clear without tonal marks, the spelling "Shaanxi" was contrived (following the [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] romanization system developed by {{w|Yuen Ren Chao}} in 1925-1926) for the province of Shǎnxī, while "Shanxi" is used for the province of Shānxī. Shaanxi is the official romanization used on the Chinese Government's official Web portal. This makes "Shaanxi" the only name of Chinese provinces that has not been romanized according to pinyin rules.
