{{also|Shanxi}}

===Etymology===
From the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] romanization of {{zh-m|陝西}}.

The double-''a'' spelling, used certainly to avoid [[homography]] with {{m|en|Shanxi}} ({{zh-m|山西}}, of ''shān'' rather than ''shǎn''), is not a feature of [[Hanyu Pinyin]] and cannot be observed elsewhere. It is likely inherited from the pre-Pinyin {{w|Sin Wenz}} system devised and employed by Communist linguists, which was toneless and had designated "{{w|Sin Wenz#Irregular spellings|irregular spellings}}" to disambiguate tonally different words in cases where homography was clearly both unavoidable and undesirable. A Sin Wenz textbook from 1938 ([https://archive.org/stream/zhongwenladinghu00xuzh#page/61/mode/1up {{lang|zh|《中文拉丁化課本》}}]) explicitly lists the pairs ''Shaansi'' ({{zh-m|陝西|tr=-}}) and ''Shansi'' ({{zh-m|山西|tr=-}}).

An alternative theory is that the double-''a'' spelling is from the {{w|Gwoyeu Romatzyh}} romanization system, where the third tone is spelled by doubling a vowel, but this is less likely considering the history of {{w|Gwoyeu Romatzyh}} and {{w|Sin Wenz}}, including the historical rivalry between the two systems. {{rfv-etym|en}}
