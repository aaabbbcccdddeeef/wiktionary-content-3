For the mistletoe, this viscous goop&nbsp;– and by the way, viscous comes to English from [[Viscum|viscum]]&nbsp;– is crucial. The '''stickiness''' means that, after eating the berries, birds often regurgitate the seeds and then wipe their bills on twigs&nbsp;– leading to the seeds' getting glued to the tree, where they can germinate and begin the cycle anew.}}
