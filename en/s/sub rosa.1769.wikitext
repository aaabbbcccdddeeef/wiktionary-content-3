===Etymology===
First attested 1654. {{bor|en|la|sub rosā||under the rose}}, from {{m|la|sub||under}} + {{m|la|rosā||rose}}.

The rose's connotation for secrecy dates back to Greek mythology. [[Aphrodite]] gave a rose to her son [[Eros]], the god of love; he, in turn, gave it to {{w|Harpocrates}}, the god of silence, to ensure that his mother's indiscretions (or those of the gods in general, in other accounts) were kept under wraps. In the Middle Ages a rose suspended from the ceiling of a council chamber pledged all present – those under the rose, that is – to secrecy.
