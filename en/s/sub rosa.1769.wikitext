===Etymology===
First attested [[w:1654|1654]], from {{etyl|la}} [[sub rosa#Latin|sub rosā]], "[[under the rose]]", from [[sub]], ("[[under]]") + [[rosa#Latin|rosā]] (meaning "[[rose]]"). The rose's connotation for secrecy dates back to Greek mythology. [[Aphrodite]] gave a rose to her son [[Eros]], the god of love; he, in turn, gave it to [[Harpocrates]], the god of silence, to ensure that his mother's indiscretions (or those of the gods in general, in other accounts) were kept under wraps. In the Middle Ages a rose suspended from the ceiling of a council chamber pledged all present - those under the rose, that is - to secrecy.
