# {{en-past of|shrink}}

====Usage notes====
In casual use, found even in careful speech, interchangeable with {{m|en|shrank}}; in careful formal use, only used for past participle "I ''have'' '''shrunk'''", while ''shrank'' is used for the past tense "I shrank". Compare {{m|en|sank}}/{{m|en|sunk}}. The inconsistent usage is due to the fact that {{m|en|shrink}} is a {{w|Germanic strong verb}}, hence conjugated via [[ablaut]] (change of vowel rather than adding {{m|en|-ed}}), but these are irregular in modern English. The past tense "shrunk" is derived from the Old English plural past "scruncon". The same form is found in other past tenses, such as "[[slunk]]".

The 1989 movie ''{{w|Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}'' (formally: ''Honey, I Shrank the Kids'' or ''Honey, I've Shrunk the Kids'') is an example of the prevalence of the casual form.

Note that in the 1844 translation of the [[w:Septuagint|Septuagint]] by Sir [[w:Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton|Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton]], the form "shrank" is used in [https://ebible.org/eng-Brenton/4MA14.htm IV Maccabees 14:4] ("None of the seven youths turned cowardly, or shrank back from death", singular subject), whereas "shrunk" is used in [http://ebible.org/eng-Brenton/1MA03.htm I Maccabees 3:6] ("Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prospered in his hand", plural subject).

{{m|en|shrunken}} is preferred and usual in adjectival use, but ''shrunk'' is not unknown here (see below).
