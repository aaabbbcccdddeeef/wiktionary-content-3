** {{audio|En-us-shrunk.ogg|Audio (US)}}

===Verb===
'''shrunk'''

# {{past of|shrink}}

====Usage notes====
In casual use, found even in careful speech, interchangeable with {{term|shrank|lang=en}}; in careful formal use, only used for past participle "I ''have'' '''shrunk'''", while ''shrank'' is used for the past tense "I shrank". Compare {{term|sank|lang=en}}/{{term|sunk|lang=en}}. Grammatically, {{term|shrink|lang=en}} is a {{w|Germanic strong verb}}, hence conjugated via [[ablaut]] (change of vowel, rather than adding {{term|-ed|lang=en}}), but these are irregular in modern English, hence the inconsistent usage.

The 1989 movie ''{{w|Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}'' (formally: ''Honey, I Shrank the Kids'' or ''Honey, I've Shrunk the Kids'') is an example of the prevalence of the casual form.
