\Ser"pent*ry\

Serpentry is a noun generally defined as a winding like a serpent's, or a place inhabited or infested by serpents.

Also, serpentry may pertain to any act or motion of a serpent or serpent like creature. These acts, such as slithering, climbing, eat, drinking, killing, sleeping, or constricting can be classified as serpentry behavior. An example of this is a corn snake, who may "slither around all serpentry like."

Serpentry behavior is not limited to but may be attributed to all of the following animals: corn snake, king snake, other snakes/serpent like creatures.  The process of a snake sleeping can be considered serpentry.  Any action by a serpent or serpent like creature may be called serpentry.  These creatures generally are unaware of their serpentry behavior, which oftentimes goes unnoticed to the non observant onlooker.  Serpentry behavior can be observed in areas that are popular serpent hang outs such as damp, dark, humid places.  Often, serpents may be observed at these types of locations performing serpentry like behavior.
