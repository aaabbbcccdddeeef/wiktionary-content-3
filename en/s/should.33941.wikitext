====Usage notes====
* ''Should'' has, as its most common meaning in modern English, the sense ''ought'' as in ''I should go, but I don't see how I can''. However, the older sense as the subjunctive of the future indicative auxiliary, ''shall'', is often used with ''I'' or ''we'' to indicate a more polite form than ''would'': ''I should like to go, but I can't''. In much speech and writing, ''should'' has been replaced by ''would'' In contexts of this kind, but it remains in conditional subjunctives: ''should'' (never ''would'') ''I go, I should wear my new dress''.
* {{sense|obligation}} Contrast with stronger auxiliary verb {{m|en|must}}, which indicates that the speaker believes the subject is [[require]]d to execute the predicate, or [[have to]] which indicates that the speaker believes the subject is required to execute, although speaker might disagree with the principle, and [[should]] which is merely [[advice]] - take it or leave it.
* {{sense|likely}} Possibility, or probability. Contrast with stronger auxiliary verb in the affirmative {{m|en|must}}, and negative sense {{m|en|can't}}, which indicate that there is a logical imperative [[certainty]] that the subject will (or will not) execute the predicate. Also compare with the weaker {{m|en|might}}, which indicates a 50/50 possibility, or probability.
* {{sense|subjunctive}} In American English, the present subjunctive is commonly used instead of ''should'' (e.g., "suggest that he ''stay''"), while in British English, ''should'' is commoner (e.g., "suggest that he ''should'' stay"). Both forms of English, however, sometimes use ''should'' in certain conditionals (e.g., "If I ''should'' be in trouble, I shall call you"). Furthermore, ''should'' is not used in independent clauses with the present subjunctive, many of which clauses are now fossilized expressions (e.g., "Peace ''be'' with you", "''suffice'' it to say"; never ''should be'' or ''should suffice'').
