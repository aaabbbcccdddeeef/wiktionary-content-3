====Usage notes====
* ''Should'' has, as its most common meaning in modern English, the sense ''ought'' as in ''I should go, but I don't see how I can''. However, the older sense as the subjunctive of the future indicative auxiliary, ''shall'', is often used with ''I'' or ''we'' to indicate a more polite form than ''would'': ''I should like to go, but I can't''. In much speech and writing, ''should'' has been replaced by ''would'' in contexts of this kind, but it remains in conditional subjunctives: ''should'' (never ''would'') ''I go, I should wear my new dress''.

* {{sense|obligation}} Contrast with stronger auxiliary verb {{term|must}}, which indicates that the subject is [[require]]d to execute the predicate.
* {{sense|likely}} Contrast with stronger auxiliary verb {{term|must}}, which indicates that the subject [[certainly]] will execute the predicate.
* See the usage notes at {{term|shall}}.
