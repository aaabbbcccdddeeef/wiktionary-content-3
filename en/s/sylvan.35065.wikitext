===Etymology===
[[File:3 Ponds Trail (8) (15614614146).jpg|thumb|A [[hardwood]] [[forest]] in the {{w|Lehigh Gap}} in the {{w|Appalachian Mountains}}, Pennsylvania, USA, in [[autumn]]]]

Borrowed from {{bor|en|ML.|sylvanus}}, possibly via {{bor|en|frm|sylvain}}, from {{der|en|la|Silvānus||Roman god of the woods}}, from {{m|la|silva||forest}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*sel-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*swel-||beam, board, frame, threshold}}. The ⟨y⟩ in {{m|la|sylvanus}} and its descendants is due to influence from {{der|en|grc|ῡ̔́λη||wood, matter}}, transliterated in the Latin style as {{m|la|hyle}}.
