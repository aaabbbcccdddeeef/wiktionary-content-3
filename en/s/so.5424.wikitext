=====Usage notes=====
Chiefly in North American use, a [[comma]] or [[pause]] is often used before the conjunction when used in the sense ''with the result that''. (A similar meaning can often be achieved by using a [[semicolon]] or [[colon]] (without the '''''so'''''), as for example: ''He drank the poison; he died.'')

=====Usage notes=====
* Use of '''''so''''' in the sense ''to the '''implied''' extent'' is discouraged in formal writing; spoken intonation which might render the usage clearer is not usually apparent to the reader, who might reasonably expect the ''extent'' to be made explicit. For example, the reader may expect ''He is '''so''' good'' to be followed by an explanation or consequence of how good ''he'' is. Devices such as use of underscoring and the [[exclamation mark]] may be used as a means of clarifying that the implicit usage is intended; capitalising ''SO'' is also used. The derivative subsenses ''very'' and ''very much'' are similarly more apparent with spoken exaggerated intonation.

* The difference between ''so'' and ''very'' in implied-extent usage is that ''very'' is more descriptive or matter-of-fact, while ''so'' indicates more emotional involvement. This ''so'' is used by both women and men, but more frequently by women. For example, ''she is very clever'' is a simple statement of opinion; ''she is <u>so</u> clever'' suggests admiration. Likewise, ''that is very typical'' is a simple statement; ''that is SO typical of him!'' is an indictment. A formal (and reserved) apology may be expressed ''I am very sorry'', but after elbowing someone in the nose during a basketball game, a man might say, ''Dude, I am <u>so</u> sorry!'' in order to ensure that it's understood as an accident.<ref>Mark Liberman, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3866 "Ask Language Log: So feminine?"], 2012 March 26</ref>
