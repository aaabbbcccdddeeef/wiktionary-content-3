==English==

===Etymology===
From '''[[subjunctive]]''', from Latin '''[[subjunctivus]]''', from prefix '''[[sub-]]''', ''under'', + '''[[junctus]]''', ''joined'', perfect passive participle of '''[[jungere]]''', ''join'', + adjective suffix '''[[-ivus]]''',
+ '''[[mood]]''', from Latin '''[[modus]]'''.

===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[subjunctive]] [[mood]]}}

# {{grammar}} [[mood#Etymology_2|Mood]] expressing an action or state which is [[hypothetical]] or [[anticipated]], including [[wish]]es and [[command]]s.
#:  If John were here, he would know what to do.
#:  If this be liberty, then give me death!

====Notes====
Subjunctive mood is used much more in some other languages, such as Spanish and Latin, than it is in English.  English has only a few remnants, and a very few words that are different from [[indicative mood]], such as ''[[wert]]'' and ''be'', and [[were]] in place of [[was]] in third person singular.
