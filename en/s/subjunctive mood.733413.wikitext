===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[subjunctive]] [[mood]]}}

# {{grammar}} [[mood#Etymology_2|Mood]] expressing an action or state which is [[hypothetical]] or [[anticipated]] rather than [[actual]], including [[wish]]es and [[command]]s.

#: ''If this '''be''' liberty, then give me death!''
#: ''I wish that I '''were''' there.''
#: ''I want that he '''go'''.''

====Usage notes====
Subjunctive mood is used much more in some other languages, such as Spanish and Latin, than it is in English. Apart from the third-person singular form without the suffix -('''e''')'''s''' (''I want that he '''go'''''), modern English has only one verb that has mutually distinguishable [[indicative mood|indicative]] and subjunctive forms &mdash; ''[[be]]''.
::* be (subjunctive present, all persons except for archaic second-person singular)
::: ''I suggest that that measure '''be''' taken.''
::* [[beest]] (archaic second-person singular, subjunctive present)
::: ''Stephano!—If thou '''beest''' Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo:—be not afeared—thy good friend Trinculo.'' -- {{RQ:Shakespeare Tempest}}
::* [[wert]] (archaic second-person singular, subjunctive past)
::: ''If thou '''wert''' pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, ...'' -- '''1611''', ''The Bible, Job 8:6'' (King James (Authorised) Version)
::: ''I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou '''wert''' cold or hot.'' -- '''1611''', ''The Bible, Revelation 3:15''  (King James (Authorised) Version)
::* [[were]] (first- and third-person singular, subjunctive past)
::: ''If John '''were''' here, he would know what to do.''
