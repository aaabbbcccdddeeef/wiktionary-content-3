===Etymology===
[[File:2012-01-17 13-20-51 Spain Canarias Ajuy.jpg|thumb|Spindrift ''(sense 1.1)'' off the [[coast#Noun|coast]] of [[Fuerteventura]], one of the [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]].]]

From {{der|en|sco|spindrift}}; further etymology uncertain.<ref name="SND">{{R:Dictionary of the Scots Language|pos=n|source=SND}}</ref> The ''{{w|Oxford English Dictionary}}'' suggests it is a variant of {{m|en|spoondrift}} {{qualifier|archaic}}, apparently due to the pronunciation of this word in southwestern Scotland,<ref name="OED">{{R:OED Online|pos=n|id=186695|date=March 2022|nodot=1}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=n}}</ref> which is derived from {{compound|en|spoon|drift|t2=mass of matter driven or forced onward together in a body, etc., especially by wind or water|nocat=1}}; {{m|en||spoon}} is a variant of {{m|en|spoom|t=to sail briskly with the wind astern, with or without sails hoisted}}.<ref>{{R:OED Online|entry=spoondrift|pos=n|id=187412|date=September 2019}}</ref> However, this is doubted by the ''{{w|Scottish National Dictionary}}'' because ''spoondrift'' is attested later than ''spindrift'' and it seems unlikely that the Scots spelling would have superseded the English one, and because the early use of the word in the form ''spenedrift'' by [[w:James Melville (Scottish minister)|James Melville]] (1556–1614) is unlikely to have derived from ''spoondrift''.<ref name="SND"/>

The word was popularized in English from the late 19th century by its use in the novels of the Scottish-born author [[w:William Black (novelist)|William Black]] (1841–1898):<ref name="OED"/> see, for example, the 1878 quotation.
