===Etymology===
Originally “as sure as eggs is eggs, and not eyren”. ''Eyren'' is the [[Old English]] plural form for ”eggs”, and ''eggs'' is derived from Old Norse. ''Eyren'' was the word form used in the south of England, but it was replaced by northern form ''eggs'', which originally was the [[Old Norse]] plural for egg.<ref>{{cite web
