The control column moved forward rapidly in response to the activation of the '''stickpusher''', decreasing the pitch angle to -3.5°, the AOA to 0°, and the vertical load to 0 G. The '''stickpusher''' then deactivated, and the flight crew moved the control column past neutral to about 5° ANU, which caused the pitch angle to increase to 8° and the AOA to increase to 11°.}}
