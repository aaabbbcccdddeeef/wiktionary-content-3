===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm}} {{term|springen|lang=enm}}, from Old English {{term|springan|lang=ang}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{recons|springaną|lang=gem-pro}} (compare {{etyl|fy|-}} {{term|springe|lang=fy}}, Dutch/German {{term|springen|lang=nl}}, Danish {{term|springe|lang=da}}. Swedish {{term|springa|lang=sv}}), from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|spr̥g̑h|lang=ine-pro}} (compare Lithuanian {{term|spreñgti|lang=lt}} ‘to push in’, Old Church Slavonic {{term||pręgti}} ‘to spin, stretch’, Ancient Greek {{term||spérchesthai}} ‘to hasten’, Sanskrit {{term||spṛhayati}} ‘is eager’).

Sense of ‘season’ 1547, from earlier ''springing time,'' ''spring-time,'' in sense of buds sprouting or “spring” up. This replaced Old English {{term|Lent|lang=ang}} by the 14th century.<ref name="etyl">{{R:Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

Sense of ‘source of water’ attested circa 1225.<ref name="etyl" />

===Verb===
{{en-verb|springs|springing|'''[[sprang]]''' ''or'' '''[[sprung]]'''|sprung}}

# To [[jump]] or [[leap]].
#: ''He '''sprang''' up from his seat.''
#* '''1900''', {{w|L. Frank Baum}}, {{w|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}
#*: She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She '''sprang''' from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.
#* '''1912''': {{w|Edgar Rice Burroughs}}, {{w|Tarzan of the Apes}}, Chapter 5
#*: Not thirty paces behind the two she crouched&mdash;Sabor, the huge lioness&mdash;lashing her tail. Cautiously she moved a great padded paw forward, noiselessly placing it before she lifted the next. Thus she advanced; her belly low, almost touching the surface of the ground--a great cat preparing to '''spring''' upon its prey.
#* '''1922''', {{w|Virginia Woolf}}, ''{{w|Jacob's Room}}'' Chapter 2
#*: Archer and Jacob jumped up from behind the mound where they had been crouching with the intention of '''springing''' upon their mother unexpectedly, and they all began to walk slowly home.
# To produce or disclose unexpectedly, especially of [[surprise]]s, [[trap]]s, etc.
#* '''29 February 2012''', Aidan Foster-Carter, BBC News [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17213948 ''North Korea: The denuclearisation dance resumes'']
#*: North Korea loves to '''spring''' surprises. More unusual is for its US foe to play along.
# {{slang}} To [[release]] or [[set free]], especially from [[prison]].

====Usage notes====
* The past-tense forms {{term|sprang|lang=en}} and {{term|sprung|lang=en}} are both well attested historically. In modern usage, {{term||sprang|lang=en}} is comparatively formal (and more often considered correct), {{term||sprung|lang=en}} comparatively informal. The past participle, however, is overwhelmingly {{term||sprung|lang=en}}; {{term||sprang||lang=en}} as a past participle is attested, but is no longer in standard use.

====Synonyms====
* {{sense|jump, leap}} [[bound]], [[jump]], [[leap]]
