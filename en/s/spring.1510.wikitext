===Etymology===
As a verb, from {{inh|en|enm|springen||to [[burst forth|burst]] or [[flow]] [[forth]], to [[sprout]], to [[emerge]], to [[happen]], to [[become]] [[known]], to [[sprinkle]]}}, from {{inh|en|ang|springan||to [[burst forth|burst]] or [[flow]] [[forth]], to [[sprout]], to [[emerge]], to [[become]] [[known]]}}, cognate with {{cog|fy|springe}}, Dutch & German {{m|nl|springen}}, {{cog|da|springe}}, {{cog|sv|springa}}. Further etymology is uncertain, but usually taken to derive from a {{der|en|gem-pro|-}} verb reconstructed as {{m|gem-pro|*springaną||to [[burst forth]]}}, from a {{der|en|ine-pro|-}} root reconstructed {{m|ine-pro|*sperǵʰ-}} whose other descendants may include {{cog|lt|spreñgti||to [[push]] (in)}}, {{cog|cu|прѧсти||to [[spin]], to [[stretch]]}}, {{cog|la|spargere||to [[sprinkle]], to [[scatter]]}}, {{cog|grc|σπέρχω||to [[hasten]]}}, {{cog|sa|स्पृहयति|tr=spṛháyati||to be [[eager]]}}. Some newer senses derived from the noun.

As a noun, from {{inh|en|enm|spring||a [[wellspring]], [[tide]], [[branch]], [[sunrise]], [[kind]] of [[dance]] or [[blow]], [[ulcer]], [[snare]], [[flock]]}}, from {{inh|en|ang|spring||[[wellspring]], [[ulcer]]}} and {{inh|en|ang|spryng||a [[jump]]}}, from [[ablaut]] forms of the {{der|en|gem-pro|-}} verb. Further senses derived from the verb and from clippings of {{m|en|day-spring}}, {{m|en|springtime}}, {{m|en|spring tide}}, etc. Its sense as the season, first attested in a work predating 1325, gradually replaced Old English {{m|ang|lencten||spring, [[Lent]]}} as that word became more specifically liturgical.

====Usage notes====
* The past-tense forms {{m|en|sprang}} and {{m|en|sprung}} are both well attested historically. In modern usage, {{m|en||sprang}} is comparatively formal (and more often considered correct), {{m|en||sprung}} comparatively informal. The past participle, however, is overwhelmingly {{m|en||sprung}}; {{m|en||sprang|}} as a past participle is attested, but is no longer in standard use.

====Synonyms====
* {{sense|jump, leap}} {{l|en|bound}}, {{l|en|jump}}, {{l|en|leap}}
* {{sense|release or set free}} {{l|en|free}}, {{l|en|let out}}, {{l|en|release}}, {{l|en|spring loose}}
