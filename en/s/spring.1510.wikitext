===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|springen}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|springan}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*springaną}} (compare {{etyl|fy|-}} {{m|fy|springe}}, Dutch/Low German/German {{m|nl|springen}}, {{etyl|da|-}} {{m|da|springe}}, {{etyl|sv|-}} {{m|sv|springa}}), from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*sperǵʰ-}} (compare {{etyl|lt|-}} {{m|lt|spreñgti||to push in}}, {{etyl|cu|-}} {{m|cu|прѧсти||to spin, stretch}}, {{etyl|grc|-}} {{m|grc|σπέρχω||I hasten}}, {{etyl|sa|-}} {{m|sa|स्पृहयति||tr=spṛhayati|is eager}}).

Sense of ‘season’ 1547, from earlier ''springing time,'' ''spring-time,'' in sense of buds sprouting or “springing” up. This replaced Old English {{term|lencten|lang=ang}} (compare ''[[Lent]]'') by the 14th century.<ref name="etyl">{{R:Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

Sense of ‘source of water’ attested circa 1225.<ref name="etyl" />
