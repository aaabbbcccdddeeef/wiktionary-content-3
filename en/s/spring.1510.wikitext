===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|springen}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|springan}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*springaną}} (compare {{cog|fy|springe}}, Dutch/Low German/German {{m|nl|springen}}, {{cog|da|springe}}, {{cog|sv|springa}}), from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*sperǵʰ-}} (compare {{cog|lt|spreñgti||to push in}}, {{cog|cu|прѧсти||to spin, stretch}}, {{cog|grc|σπέρχω||I hasten}}, {{cog|sa|स्पृहयति||is eager}}).

Sense of ‘season’ 1547, from earlier ''springing time,'' ''spring-time,'' in sense of buds sprouting or “springing” up. This replaced Old English {{m|ang|lencten}} (compare ''[[Lent]]'') by the 14th century.<ref name="etyl">{{R:Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

Sense of ‘source of water’ attested circa 1225.<ref name="etyl" />

====Usage notes====
* The past-tense forms {{m|en|sprang}} and {{m|en|sprung}} are both well attested historically. In modern usage, {{m|en||sprang}} is comparatively formal (and more often considered correct), {{m|en||sprung}} comparatively informal. The past participle, however, is overwhelmingly {{m|en||sprung}}; {{m|en||sprang|}} as a past participle is attested, but is no longer in standard use.
