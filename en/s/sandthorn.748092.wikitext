# The Sandthorn Berry is known as Hippophae rhamnoides to scientists. It is a tart-to-sweet fruit that flourishes in the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. What sets it apart from just about every other fruit is its unique ability to survive in the harshest of cold climates and shallow soil.
The Sandthorn Berry has been shown to be righ in protein, organic acids, amino acids and vitamins. The berry is an unsurpassed natural source of several caratenes, tocopherols and flavonoids. The berry also has a remarkably high content of other essential fatty acids, microelements and phytosterols.
The Sandthorn Berry has a variety of names depending, of course, on where it is grown and used. These names include: Seabuckthorn or Sea Buckthorn, Sanddorn, Finbar, Rokitnik, Jadu-paudha and Dhar-bu.
According to Oriental history, the Chinese were the first culture to utilize this berry as a remedy. Over a thousand years ago, it was recorded in ''Yue Wang Yao'' then from the Tang Dynasty and in Sibu Yidian, which writing was completed in the 8th century.
