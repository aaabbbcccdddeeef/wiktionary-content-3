#*: The Seleucid empire in its turn was still, in outward shape, very much the empire of Persia under different rulers; the great '''satrapies''' still remained, their military nature emphasised by the governor of a '''satrapy''' being no longer called satrap but ''strategos'', 'general'.

#*: A '''satrapy'''′s borders were generally the same as those of the previously independent kingdom, with the satrap stationed in the old capital.{{...}}The Great King expected two things from the '''satrapies''': a regular supply of taxes (called "tribute" because it underlined the '''satrapy'''′s subordination to the king) and units for the Persian army when needed.
