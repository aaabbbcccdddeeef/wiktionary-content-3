==English==

===Etymology===
{{etyl|ang}} ''sibling''. The term apparently meant merely [[kin]] or [[relative]] until the 20th century when its necessity for the study of genetics led to its broader use. For example, the [[w:Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] has a 1903 citation in which "sibling" must be defined for those who don't know the intended meaning.
: "1903 K. PEARSON in Biometrika II. 369 These [calculations] will enable us..to predict the probable character in any individual from a knowledge of one or more parents or brethren (‘siblings’, = brothers or sisters)." ("Sibling," OED.)
