#* Averil Cameron, 'The Cost of Orthodoxy', ''Church History and Religious Culture'' 93 (2013), p. 353:
#*: {{quote|en|An equally sensational recent Spanish film, Agora (2009), set in Alexandria in the early fifth century, with the Christian storming of the Serapaeum (391), followed nearly a generation later by the murder by Christians of the philosopher and teacher Hypatia (415). In the film Cyril of Alexandria, admittedly no '''shrinking violet''', is shown looking like a Taliban leader. The interpretation in the film is certainly highly exaggerated; yet such things did happen.}}
