====Usage notes====
* {{sense|structured query language}} The first form of SQL was called {{term||SEQUEL}}, pronounced like {{term|sequel}}. As a result, many speakers still pronounce {{term||SQL}} like {{term||sequel}}. (For these speakers, {{term||SQL}} is an [[Appendix:Glossary#acronym|acronym]].) However, since 1986, the SQL standard has declared that it is to be pronounced as three letters: S-Q-L.
