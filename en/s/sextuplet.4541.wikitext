====Usage notes====

Some authorities (for instance, Hugo Riemann, Theodore Bacon and Franklin Taylor) consider the double triplet to be a "false sextuplet", others (for instance, Evangelos Sembos, John Stainer and William Alexander Barrett) define the sextuplet solely as the double triplet, others (such as Antoine Damour, Aimable Burnett, and Élie Elwart) do not differentiate between the two.
