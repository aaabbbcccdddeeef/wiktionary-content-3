====Usage notes====
* In the classical period, this was usually interpreted as applying to the city of [[Rome]]'s inhabitants; occasionally, it applied to the entire [[Roman Empire]]. In modern times, it continues to carry those connotations. It is also used in modern [[Italy]] by the [[municipal]] government of modern Rome.
