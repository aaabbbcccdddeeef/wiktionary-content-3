'''SPQR'''
# Roman [[initialism]] for “'''''s'''enatus '''p'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''omanus''”, “'''''S'''enatus '''p'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''omanus''”, “'''''S'''enatus '''P'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''omanus''”, or in the original Roman [[typography]], SENATVS·POPVLVSQVE·ROMANVS.  Latin for “''The Senate and the Roman People''”.

====Usage notes====
In the classical period, this was interpreted as applying (in most cases) to the city of [[Rome]]'s inhabitants, but occasionally to the entire [[Roman Empire]]. In modern times, it continues to carry those connotations, but is also used in modern [[Italy]] by the [[municipal]] government of Rome.
