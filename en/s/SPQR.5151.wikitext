====Usage notes====
In the classical period, this was interpreted as applying (in most cases) to the city of [[Rome]]'s inhabitants, but occasionally to the entire [[Roman Empire]]. In modern times, it continues to carry those connotations, but is also used in modern [[Italy]] by the [[municipal]] government of Rome.
