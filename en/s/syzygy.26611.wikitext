Syzygy (Gr.). A Gnostic term, meaning a pair or couple, one active, the other passive. Used especially of ,Æons.         (Theosophical Glossary) 


First the Point, the Monad, Bythus (the Deep), the unknown and unknowable Father. Then the  Triangle, Bythus and the first emanated pair or Duad, Nous (Mind) and its syzygy Aletheia (Truth). Then the  (Square), the dual Duad Tetraktys or Quaternary, two males ||, the Logos (Word) and Anthrōpos (Man), two females, their syzygies, Zōē (Life) and Ekklēsia (the Church or Assembly), Seven in all. The Triangle, the Potentiality of Spirit; the Square, the Potentiality of matter; the Vertical Straight Line, the Potency of Spirit, and the Horizontal, the Potency of matter. Next comes the Pentagram , the Pentad, the mysterious symbol of the Mānasaputras or Sons of Wisdom, which together with their syzygies make 10, or the Decad; and last of all, the Hexalpha or interlaced Triangles the Hexad, which with their syzygies make 12, or the Dodecad. Such are the contents of the Pl‘rōma or Completion, the Ideas in the Divine Mind, 28 in all for Bythus or the Father is not reckoned, as it is the Root of all. The two small circles within the Plērōma are the syzygy Christos-Pneuma (Christ and the Holy Spirit); these are after-emanations, and as such, from one aspect, typify the descent of Spirit to inform and evolve Matter, which essentially proceeds from the same source; and from another, the descent or incarnation of the Kumāras or the Higher Egos of Humanity.   (H.P.B. Collected Writings VOLUME XIII 1890-1891 p. 16)
