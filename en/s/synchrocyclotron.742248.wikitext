# A [[particle accelerator]] like a [[cyclotron]], but which operates at variable frequency to account for the particles gaining energy, allowing for greater energies to be achieved.
#*'''2004''': The '''synchrocyclotron''' was able to accelerate protons to sufficient energies that collisions with nuclei produce pions, the lightest particles that, we now know, are made form a single quark and an antiquark. — Frank Close, ''Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford 2004, p. 50)
