# {{ice hockey}} The slapshot is the fastest and hardest [[shot]] in [[ice hockey]]. The slapshot is a maneuver where the [[hockey stick]] is quickly whipped into the ice surface to build up potential energy in the stick to act as a spring, where upon release it strikes the [[hockey puck]], imparting a larger amount of power than a direct push of the puck through muscle power alone.
