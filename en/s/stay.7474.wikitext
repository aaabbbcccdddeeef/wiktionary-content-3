===Pronunciation===
* {{enPR|stā}}, {{IPA|en|/steɪ/}}
* {{audio|en|en-us-stay.ogg|Audio (US)}}
* {{rhymes|en|eɪ}}

===Etymology 1===
{{PIE root|en|steh₂}}
From {{inh|en|enm|steyen}}, {{m|enm|staien}}, from {{der|en|fro|estayer}}, {{m|fro|estaier||to fix, prop up, support, stay}}, from {{m|fro|estaye}}, {{m|fro|estaie||a prop, stay}}, from {{der|en|dum|staeye||a prop, stay}}, a contracted form of {{m|dum|staede}}, {{m|dum|stade|t=a prop, stay, help, aid}} (compare {{cog|dum|staeyen}}, {{m|dum|staeden||to make firm, stay, support, hold still, stabilise}}), from {{der|en|frk|*stad||a site, place, location, standing}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*stadiz||a standing, place}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*stéh₂tis||standing}}. Influenced by {{cog|ang|stæġ}} {{gloss|"a stay, rope"; see below}}. Cognate with {{cog|ang|stede}}, {{m|ang|stæde||a place, spot, locality, fixed position, station, site, standing, status, position of a moving body, stopping, standing still, stability, fixity, firmness, steadfastness}}, {{cog|sv|stödja||to prop, support, brace, hold up, bolster}}, {{cog|is|stöðug||continuous, stable}}. More at {{l|en|stead}}, {{l|en|steady}}.

Sense of "remain, continue" may be due to later influence from {{cog|fro|ester}}, {{m|fro|esteir||to stand, be, continue, remain}}, from {{cog|la|stāre||stand}}, from the same Proto-Indo-European root above; however, derivation from this root is untenable based on linguistic and historical grounds<ref>Whitney, ''Century Dictionary and Encyclopedia'', stay.</ref>.

An alternative etymology derives {{der|en|fro|estaye}}, {{m|fro|estaie}}, from {{der|en|frk|*staku|*staka|t=stake, post}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*stakô||stake, bar, stick, pole}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*(s)teg-||rod, pole, stick}}, making it cognate with {{cog|ang|staca||pin, stake}}, {{cog|ang|stician||to stick, be placed, lie, remain fixed}}. Cognate with Albanian {{m|asq|shtagë||a long stick, a pole}}. More at {{l|en|stake}}, {{l|en|stick}}.
