{{en-infl-reg-consonant|suck||}}

# To use the [[mouth]] to pull in [[liquid]] substances for ingestion or to perform a similar act on solid material without [[ingestion]].
# (''colloquial; please see usage note'') Term of general disparagement, indicating the subject or situation has no redeeming qualities.
# (''colloquial; please see usage note'') With ''at'', indicates a particular area of deficiency.
#: ''You're great at baseball, but you suck at golf.''

::'''''Usage Note:''''' ''Suck'' (defs. #2 & #3) is sometimes considered impolite or mildly vulgar.  With the word increasingly used by all strata of people in all manner of environments and situations, it is becoming less thought of as a possible vulgarism, and generally may just be thought of as impolite in certain situations.  The increasing "acceptance factor" and "hipness factor" of ''suck'' as used in defs. #2 and #3 have largely (although not entirely) taken out any potential shock value in the word, although again, it may still be found to be unacceptable or inappropriate in certain situations.
