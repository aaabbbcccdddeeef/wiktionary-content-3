====Adjective====
{{en-adj|er}}

# {{lb|en|informal}} Likely to stick; [[sticking]], [[sticky]].
#: ''A [[non-stick|non-'''stick''']] pan. A [[stick plaster|'''stick''' plaster]].''
#: ''A '''sticker''' type of glue. The '''stickest''' kind of gum.''

=====Usage notes=====
* The adjective is more informal than nonstandard due to the prevalence of examples such as "non-stick pan" or "stick plaster".
* The comparative and superlative remain nonstandard (vs. {{m|en|stickier}} and {{m|en|stickiest}}) and are sometimes seen in between quotation marks to reflect it.

=====Derived terms=====

* {{l|en|non-stick}}, {{l|en|nonstick}}
* {{l|en|stick note}}
{{der-mid}}
* {{l|en|stick plaster}}
{{der-bottom}}

===Etymology 3===
Possibly a metaphorical use of the first etymology ("twig, branch"), possibly derived from the Yiddish [[schtick]].
