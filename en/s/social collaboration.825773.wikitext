Social collaboration refers to processes that help multiple people interact, share information to achieve any common goal. These processes  are inherently democratic in nature, inclusive and available to all who may need to take part towards achieving  the common goal.  Usually, the term is applied to interactions leveraging interpersonal and social networks and is rarely used in a work oriented context.
