====Usage notes====
* Under many statutory schemes, a "surviving spouse" is not merely a spouse who outlives the other, but must outlive the other by a set period, typically 120 hours; this is to prevent controversies over the disposal of property where both partners in a marriage fall victim to an accident, but one is prevented from dying longer than the other (particularly where the person who is saved for some brief additional period is unable to communicate during that time).
