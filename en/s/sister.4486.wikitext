==English==

===Etymology===
{{PIE word|en|swésōr}}
From {{inh|en|enm|sister}}, {{m|enm|suster}}, from {{inh|en|ang|swustor}}, {{m|ang|sweoster}}, {{m|ang|sweostor||sister, nun}}; from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*swestēr||sister}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*swésōr||sister}}.

In standard English, the form with ''i'' is due to contamination with {{cog|non|systir||sister}}.

====Usage notes====
* In [[Roman Catholicism]], a distinction is often drawn (especially by members of female [[religious order]]s) between nuns and sisters, the former being cloistered and devoted primarily to prayer, the latter being more active, doing work such as operating hospitals, caring for the poor, or teaching.
* The plural {{m|en|sistren}} is no longer commonly used for biological sisters in contemporary English (although it was in the past) but may be found in some religious, feminist, or poetic usage.
