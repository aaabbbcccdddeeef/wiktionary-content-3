#* '''1989''', R. P. Sharma, D. K. Salunkhe, ''Chapter 8: Solanum Glycoalkaloids'', Peter R. Cheeke (editor), ''Toxicants of Plant Origin: Alkaloids'', Volume 1: Alkaloids, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=79i9mfl2PO4C&pg=PA214&dq=%22solanine%22%7C%22solanines%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22solanine%22%7C%22solanines%22&f=false page 214],
#*: Apparently the high activity of α-'''solanine''' injected into the bloodstream may be due to cholinesterase inhibition, while the lesser effects of orally administered α-'''solanine''' could reflect its poor adsorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
#* '''1996''', M. M. T. Janssen, H. M. C. Put, M. J. R. Nut, ''Chapter Two: Natural Toxins'', John De Vries (editor), ''Food Safety and Toxicity'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ag4z1Pp9cLAC&pg=PA14&dq=%22solanine%22%7C%22solanines%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22solanine%22%7C%22solanines%22&f=false page 14],
#*: The most potent inhibitors are found in potatoes, and of these the most active component is the glycoalkaloid '''solanine'''.
#*: The toxicity of '''solanine''' has been the subject of extensive study.
