===Noun===
{{en-noun}}
A skyhook is defined by Dictionary.com as a "fanciful hook imagined to be suspended in the air." Of course, there is no actual hook. This word is a metaphorical euphemism describing anything that takes one out of his/her lesser conditions and flings that person into some better place, so to speak. For example, in ''Songs of the Doomed'', by Hunter S. Thompson, he refers to himself as a skyhook to a prisoner whom Hunter intends to help "escape the System". A skyhook is an "out". Other similar euphemisms might be "a ticket to ride", or "a foot in the door", etc.
