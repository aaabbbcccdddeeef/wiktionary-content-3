{{wikipedia|She (disambiguation)}}
{{wikipedia}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|sche}}, {{m|enm|hye}}, from earlier {{m|enm|scho}}, {{m|enm|hyo}}, {{m|enm|ȝho}}, a phonetic development of {{inh|en|ang|hēo}}, {{m|ang|hīo}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*hijō||this, this one|g=f}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*ḱe-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*ḱey-||this, here}}. Cognate with {{cog|en|-}} dialectal {{m|en|hoo}}, {{cog|sco|scho}}, {{m|sco|shu}}, {{cog|stq|jo}}, {{m|stq|ju}}, {{cog|fy|hja}}, {{cog|frr|jü}}, {{cog|da|hun}}, {{cog|sv|hon}}. More at {{l|en|he}}.

Despite the similarity in appearance, the {{cog|ang|-}} feminine demonstrative {{m|ang|sēo||that}} (the cognate of {{cog|nl|zij}} and {{cog|de|sie}}) is probably not the source of {{cog|enm|-}} forms in ''sch-''. Rather, the ''sch-'' developed out of a change in stress upon ''hío'' resulting in ''hió'', spelt {{m|enm|ȝho}} ({{m|enm|ȝh}} = {{m|enm|hȝ}}, compare ''wh'' = ''hw'', ''lh'' = ''hl'', etc.), and the ''h'' was palatalised into the ''sh'' sound. Similar alteration can be seen in the name ''Shetland'', from {{cog|non|-}} ''Hjaltland''; {{m|enm|ȝho}} is the immediate parent form of {{cog|enm|-}} ''scho'' and ''sche''.

====Usage notes====
* Since at least the 1920s and 30s, some [[gay]] or [[queer]] men refer to other gay or queer men and/or themselves with ''she''/''her'' pronouns, as well as with other feminine terms such as ''[[Miss]]'' and ''[[girl]]'', to signal their sexuality rather than their<!-- sex or--> gender identity;<ref>Greville G. Corbett, ''The Expression of Gender'' (2013), page 26: "There are uses of she to refer to people who are attributed and claim male sex. Rudes and Healy 1979 give many examples collected in their ethnolinguistic investigation among gay males in Buffalo, NY."</ref> this has sometimes been termed "the [[gay she]]":<ref>Kirby Conrod, "Pronouns in motion", in ''Lavender Linguistics'' (2018), page 11</ref><ref>Anna T., ''[http://cup.columbia.edu/book/opacity-minority-improvisation/9783837651331 Opacity - Minority - Improvisation]: An Exploration of the Closet Through Queer Slangs and Postcolonial Theory'' ({{ISBN|9783837651331}}, 2020), pages 84-85</ref>
{{rel-top|examples, details, and additional references}}
* '''1997''', Anna Livia, Kira Hall, ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality'', page 359:
*: In English, gay men often use the female pronoun ''she'' to refer to other gay men:
*: SPEAKER A: Speaking of fags, where is Miss Thing?
*: SPEAKER B: You mean Ron?
*: SPEAKER A: Yeah.
*: SPEAKER B: I don't know where she is.
*: (Rudes and Healy ['Is She For Real'] 1979: 61)
*: {{...|In this example, Ron is first introduced as Miss Thing, a feminine designator that is then anaphorized as ''she'' from grammatical necessity There are also cases where no antecedent feminine is introduced to justify the use of feminine pronouns, [...] In this case, ''she'' is deictic rather than anaphoric and therefore stands out as more marked. [...] This use of female pronouns to refer to gay men is limited to specifically gay contexts; it can have dire social consequences if the device misfires. It is important to note that}} this linguistic strategy is not intended to reflect a feminine persona so much as to dissociate the speaker from heterosexual alliance. As such, it is a statement of sexual orientation rather than of sexual [/gender] identity. The men who use these feminine forms to refer to themselves or to other gay men are designating themselves, as well as the referents, as traitors to heterosexual masculinity.
* '''1994'''<!-- (also reprinted in 2008)-->, George Chauncey, ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940'', pages 56-57:
*: One indication of the extent to which men became accustomed to thinking of fairies as pseudo-women was provided in 1939 by a State Liquor Authority investigator who casually referred to a fairy (who went by a woman's name but dressed in conventional male attire) as "she," even though he was testifying at a formal hearing of the Authority. "We did get in a conversation with Beverly," he testified, "and she stated she liked us very much." When asked by an attorney whether he meant "she" or "he," he explained that the fairies "address themselves by these effeminate names and refer to one another in the effeminate terms," and promptly continued: "She [the fairy] made a date with Mr. Van Wagner and myself for Saturday night."
