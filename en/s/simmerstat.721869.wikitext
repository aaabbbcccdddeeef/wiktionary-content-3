# An electrical control device which turns a heating element such as a stove [[hotplate]] or [[grill]] on and off in a fixed cycle.  The control knob on the simmerstat determines what proportion is spent on, and what off.  For example with the knob turned to a quarter it might use a cycle of 5 seconds on then 15 seconds off, thus giving roughly a quarter of the heating element's full power.

A Simmerstat is a different type of device - used usually to control a 
cooker hot plate it is a switching device that does not operate on the 
temperature of the item you are controlling. This unit has a small heating 
element within its casing which is wrapped around a bimetal strip to control 
the switching of the device. When you turn the simmerstat on it applies 
power to the item you want to use and also to its own internal element this 
heats and when the bimetal strip has moved, which is determined by how far 
you turn the control on, the switch mechanism flips and the item is switched 
off, including the internal element. Once cooled it comes back on again
