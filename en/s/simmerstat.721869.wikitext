# An electrical control device which turns a heating element such as a stove [[hotplate]] or [[grill]] on and off in a fixed cycle.  The control knob on the simmerstat determines what proportion is spent on, and what off.  For example with the knob turned to a quarter it might use a cycle of 5 seconds on then 15 seconds off, thus giving roughly a quarter of the heating element's full power.
