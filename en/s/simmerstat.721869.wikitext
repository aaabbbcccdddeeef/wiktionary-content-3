{{en-noun}}
# An electrical control device that turns a heating element such as a stove, [[hotplate]] or [[grill]] on and off in a user-selectable duty cycle. The control knob on the simmerstat determines what proportion is spent on, and what off. For example, with the knob turned to a quarter it might use a duty cycle of 5 seconds on then 15 seconds off, thus giving roughly 25 percent of the heating element's full power.[http://www.emkayheater.com/simmerstat.html]<!-- not sure this link is fantastic -->
