|text=Some people in Asia during pre-Columbian times also made use of the seeds of the plants ''Zanthoxylum simulans'' and ''Eanthoxylum bungeanum'', now known as '''Szechuan pepper'''. Szechuan peppercorns evoke a tingling, numbing sensation produced by its active ingredient, alpha-sanshool. Like black pepper, '''Szechuan pepper''' is chemically and experientially distinct from chili pepper.}}
