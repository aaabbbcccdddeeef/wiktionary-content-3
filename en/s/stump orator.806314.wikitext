A '''"stump orator"''' is a term for a [[politician]] who is ready to take up any question of the day, usually a political one, and harangue upon it from any platform offhand.

From this has also evolved the journalistic trick of describing a politician as "stumping" around his constituency at election time, conflating the tree stump s/he leaps upon at every opportunity, and the slightly rougher verb of "stump" as opposed to "walk" or "stride".
