===Etymology===
{{rfe|de}}

Gruber means “digger” or “grubber,” ostensibly of a ditch or a groove (Grube). In Austrian German, Schickl could mean either money or possibly fate, so with both words combined, Schicklgruber could translate into “Moneygrubber” or a bit more clunky “Fate-digger.” <ref>Etymology of Schickelgruber|https://nyfos.org/kurt-weill-schicklgruber/#:~:text=In%20Austrian%20German%2C%20Schickl%20could,clunky%20%E2%80%9CFate%2Ddigger.%E2%80%9D]]
