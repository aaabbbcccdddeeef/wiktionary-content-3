‘We got off the coach and the National Front was there … People spat at us’|author=Paul Rees|passage=We [the black players]’d get off the coach at away matches and the National Front would be right there in your face. In those days, we didn’t have security and we’d have to run the gauntlet. We’d get to the players’ entrance and there’d be spit on my jacket or Cyrille’s shirt. It was a '''sign of the times'''.}}
