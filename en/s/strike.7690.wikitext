====Usage notes====
* The past participle of ''strike'' is usually {{m|en|struck}} (e.g. ''He'd struck it rich'', or ''When the clock had struck twelve'', etc.); {{m|en|stricken}} is significantly rarer. However, it is still found in transitive constructions where the subject is the object of an implied action, especially in the phrases "stricken with/by (an [[affliction]])" or "stricken (something) from the record" (e.g. ''The Court has stricken the statement from the record'', or ''The city was stricken with disease'', etc.). Except for in these contexts, ''stricken'' is almost never found in informal or colloquial speech.
