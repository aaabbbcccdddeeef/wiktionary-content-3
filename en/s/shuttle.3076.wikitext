===Etymology===
From {{OE.}} ''[[scytel]]'' (dart, arrow), from {{Ger.}} ''skutilaz'' (compare {{ON.}} ''skutill'' (harpoon)), from {{PG.}} ''skut-'' (project) (see ''[[shoot]]''). Name for loom weaving instrument, recorded from 1338, is from a sense of being "shot" across the threads. The back-and-forth imagery inspired the extension to "passenger trains" in 1895, aircraft in 1942, and spacecraft in 1969, as well as older terms such as ''[[shuttlecock]]''.
