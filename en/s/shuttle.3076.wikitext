===Etymology===
From {{etyl|ang|en}} {{term|scytel||dart, arrow|lang=ang}}, from {{proto|Germanic|skutilaz|lang=en}} (compare Old Norse {{term|skutill||harpoon|lang=non}}), from {{proto|Germanic|skut-|project|title=|lang=en}} (see {{term|shoot|lang=en}}). Name for loom weaving instrument, recorded from 1338, is from a sense of being "shot" across the threads. The back-and-forth imagery inspired the extension to "passenger trains" in 1895, aircraft in 1942, and spacecraft in 1969, as well as older terms such as {{term|shuttlecock|lang=en.
