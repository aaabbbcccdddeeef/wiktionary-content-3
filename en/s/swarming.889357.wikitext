{{merge|swarming}}
[[Category:Move to Wiktionary 2008-01]]

"Swarming" is the term now applied to the crime where an unsuspecting innocent bystander is attacked by several culprits at once, with no know motive.  The objective of swarmings appears to usually be just to inflict injury to the victim for sport or thrill, as often the victim's belongings carried on person are not taken.

At this point, the term appears to be used mostly in Canadian media and law.
