== Subclassing ==
: In the context of Microsoft Windows, ''subclassing'' refers to a substitution of a Windows procedure (procedure A) with another (procedure B.) Procedure B intercepts calls to A for its own use, but is also responsible for passing to A any unprocessed messages.
This can be useful for changing the default function of controls. For example, a Checkbox control  may alternate from checked to unchecked in response to mouse clicks; subclassing might allow an alternation from checked to grayed out.
