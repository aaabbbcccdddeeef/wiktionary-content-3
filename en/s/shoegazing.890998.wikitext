{{en-noun|-}}

# {{context|British|lang=en}} A type of [[Britpop]] or other [[indie]] music of the 1990s, characterised by a dreamlike sound making much use of effect pedals, and by a detached or introverted performance style.
#* '''2006''', James Buckley, ''Celebrate Myself'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=fbJt-4mncQ8C&pg=PA12&dq=%22shoegazing%22%7C%22shoegazings%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zbxwU97BEIWekwXXooEY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22shoegazing%22%7C%22shoegazings%22&f=false page 12],
#*: "{{...}}Anyway, correct me if I'm wrong here, Danny, but wasn't it you who told me that true '''shoegazing''' began and ended with Slowdive's 12-inch debut: the imaginatively titled, 'Slowdive'?”
#*: “You're taking me out of context here, dude. What I meant was that it was the epoch of the genre. The other bands still made a valid contribution, they just didn't define the moment."
#* '''2011''', Barney Hoskyns, ''Lowside of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Q_DOvgMH-KgC&pg=PA491&dq=%22shoegazing%22%7C%22shoegazings%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zbxwU97BEIWekwXXooEY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22shoegazing%22%7C%22shoegazings%22&f=false page 491],
#*: Johansson and Sitek started out in more faithful lo-fi style before filtering the songs through an indie-rock sensibility that's equal parts postpunk-gothic, 4AD dreampop, '''shoegazing''' drone, and TV on the Radio epicness.
#* '''2013''', Pete Crigler, ''Majorlabelland And Assorted Oddities'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=cZcGAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=%22shoegazing%22%7C%22shoegazings%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zbxwU97BEIWekwXXooEY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22shoegazing%22%7C%22shoegazings%22&f=false page 91],
#*: Then in 2003, they released ''Still Electric'' only on their website; with this album, they'd taken on more of a '''shoegazing''' style of rock, similar to Chapterhouse or Catherine Wheel.
