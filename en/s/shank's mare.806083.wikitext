'''Shank's mare''' is a phrase referring to [[walking]]--i.e., to "ride Shank's mare" is to travel on foot.  The phrase is believed to be [[Scottish English|Scottish]] in origin, derived from the use of "shank" to refer to the part of the human leg between the [[knee]] and [[ankle]] (more commonly known in modern times as the shin). [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sha4.htm]   One theory cites "shank's mare" as derived from a horse-drawn [[lawn mower]] manufactured by Shanks & Company Ltd. (founded 1853) which required that the human operator walk behind the device to guide the horse; however, refences to the phrase in Scottish literature pre-date the existence of the Shanks lawn mower.
