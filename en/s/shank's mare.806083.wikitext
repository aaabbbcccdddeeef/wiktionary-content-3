One theory cites "shank's mare" as derived from a horse-drawn [[lawn mower]] manufactured by Shanks & Company Ltd. (founded 1853) which required that the human operator walk behind the device to guide the horse; however, references to the phrase in Scottish literature pre-date the existence of the Shanks lawn mower&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/shanks-mare.html |author=Gary Martin |title=Shanks' mare}}</ref>
