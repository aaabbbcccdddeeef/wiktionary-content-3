*<font face="Brush Script MT" color="red" size="4">[[Rafter table:]]</font> '''Image 1''' shows a cut away view of the Steel Square. The top number is the pitch of the rafter. Ie.The intersection of a 10"/12" Pitch displays 15.62". This indicates that the length of a common rafter measures exactly 15.62" per foot of run. Run is the horizontal or level distance the rafter travels. A 20Ft. wide house has a run of 10 FT per rafter.   
*<font face="Brush Script MT" color="red" size="4">[[Common Rafter per foot of run:]]</font> The common rafter connects the peak of a roof (the ''ridge'') to the base of a roof (the ''plate''). This number gives the length ([[hypotenuse]]) of the common rafter per twelve units of [[horizontal]] distance (''run''). See '''Image 2'''
*<font face="Brush Script MT" color="red" size="4">[[Hip or Valley rafter per foot of run:]]</font> The hip or valley rafter also connects the ridge to the plate, but lies at a 45-degree angle to the common rafter. This number gives the length of the hip or valley rafter per seventeen units of run. See '''Image 3''' This illustrates the relationship between hip,jack and common rafters and how they tie into the ridge and bottom plate. 
*<font face="Brush Script MT" color="red" size="4">[[Differance in lengths Jacks:]]</font> The jack rafters lie in the same plane as the common rafter but connect the top plate (the ''wall'') or ridge board to the hip or valley rafter respectively. Since the hip or valley rafter meets the ridge board and the common rafter at angles of 45 degrees, the jack rafters will have varying lengths when they intersect the hip or valley. Depending on the spacing of the rafters, their lengths will vary by a constant factor—this number is the common difference. See '''Image 3'''
*<font face="Brush Script MT" color="red" size="4">[[Side cut length of Jack rafters:]]</font>: In carpentry, the ''side cut'' is the beveled angle at the end of a board (in this case, the jack rafter). This angle can be cut on the fly by aligning this given number on the blade of the steel square and the twelve-inch mark on the tongue, and drawing a line along the tongue.See '''Image 6''' 
*<font face="Brush Script MT" color="red" size="4">[[Cutting rafters:]]</font> Common,hip and valley criple rafters are all cut in a similar way. The rafters rise
is marked on the tontue and 12 is placed on the edge of the refter. The Hip and valley use 17 as referance line and the corresponding rise is marked where the tongue intersects the edge of the rafter. See '''Image 5'''
