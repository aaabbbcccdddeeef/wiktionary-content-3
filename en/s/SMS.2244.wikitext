# {{italbrac|Numismatics}} [[Special Mint Set]], a special collector set of coins (containing one coin of each contemporary denomination) issued by the US Mint for each of 3 years; 1965, 1966 and 1967. They were produced as a substitution of proof sets when proof coin minting was discontinued in 1965. The quality of an SMS coin is higher than that of a circulating coin, but not as high as a proof coin. Proof coin production was resumed in 1968 and SMS production was ceased. A limited number of 1964 coins are also known to have been produced as SMS coins.
