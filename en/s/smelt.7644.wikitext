# Production of [[metal]], especially iron, from [[ore]] in a process that involves [[melt|melting]] and chemical [[reduction]] of metal [[compound|compounds]] into purified metal.
# Any of the various liquids or semi-molten solids produced and used during the course of such production.

#*: The green liquor, ie, [sic] the solution obtained on dissolving the '''smelt''', contains an insoluble residue called dregs, which gives it a dark green appearance.
#* '''1996,''' Arthur J. Wilson, ''The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Time and Their Impact on Civilization'',
#*: When the '''smelt''' was complete the crucible could be lifted out and the metal poured directly into the moulds, thus avoiding the need to break it up and remelt […]
#* '''2000,''' Julian Henderson, ''The Science and Archaeology of Materials: An Investigation of Inorganic Materials'',
#*: […] can vary in different positions in the furnace and during the '''smelt'''.
#*: Furnaces are unlikely to survive the '''smelts'''; all that often remains on metal production sites is just furnace bases and broken fragments of furnaces […]

#*: Women are allowed to play some small part in the '''smelt''' if they are breastfeeding or post-menopausal (van der Merwe and Avery, 1988). <!-- Confused? So is Ms. Moore. The smelt is considered allegorical for the female reproductive process, but woman who are pregnant or capable of pregnancy are considered detrimental to the smelt, so can't participate. -->
