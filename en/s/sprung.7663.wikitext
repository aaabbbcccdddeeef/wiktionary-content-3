====Usage notes====
* The adjective {{term||sprung|lang=en}}, unlike (say) {{term||infatuated|lang=en}}, does not normally take a complement; a person may be infatuated ''with'' someone, but is simply ''sprung''. As with {{term|crazy|lang=en}} or {{term|gaga|lang=en}}, the target of the emotion is normally indicated by surrounding context; this is seen in the 1992 and 2003 quotations above. However, while relatively uncommon, it is possible for {{term||sprung|lang=en}} to take a complement, construed with a preposition such as {{term|over|lang=en}} (much like {{term||gaga|lang=en}}); this is seen in the 2005 quotation above.
