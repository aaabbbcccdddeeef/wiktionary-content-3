====Usage notes====
* The adjective {{m|en||sprung}}, unlike (say) {{m|en||infatuated}}, does not normally take a complement; a person may be infatuated ''with'' someone, but is simply ''sprung''. As with {{m|en|crazy}} or {{m|en|gaga}}, the target of the emotion is normally indicated by surrounding context; this is seen in the 1992 and 2003 quotations above. However, while relatively uncommon, it is possible for {{m|en||sprung}} to take a complement, construed with a preposition such as {{m|en|over}} (much like {{m|en||gaga}}); this is seen in the 2005 quotation above.
