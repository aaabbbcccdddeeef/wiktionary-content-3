#* '''1810''', ''Decoy Elephants Catching a Male'', in Enos Bronson (editor), ''Select Reviews of Literature, and Spirit of Foreign Magazines'', Volume 3, [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=AvQ0AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA123&dq=%22koomkie%22|%22koomkies%22+-intitle:%22koomkie%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZDD7Tr_4AbCTiQfPlvmuAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22koomkie%22|%22koomkies%22%20-intitle%3A%22koomkie%22&f=false page 123],
#*: Though on some occasions the mahouts accompany the ''koomkies'' up to the '''''saun''''', yet it is safer, and generally the most sure and easy mode, for them to dismount in some contiguous cover with their blankets and ropes, leading the ''koomkies'' to the '''''saun''''', towards which they proceed in the most cunning style.
