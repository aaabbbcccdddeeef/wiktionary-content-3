===Etymology===
Of {{etyl|nl|en}} origin from the 17th century. From the 18th century and on, Skagerrak was the official name on maps, whereas [[Kattegatt]] was the vulgar name between sailors. In time, Kattegatt came to be the more common name and Skagerrak only meant the outer part of the area, between Skagen and Norway. In the 19th century the names were still used synonymously. ''Skagerrak'' contains a prefix from the name [[Skagen]], and a word meaning “straight stretch” (''[[rak]]'', from Dutch or Low German; in modern Dutch ''[[rak]]'' is a straight stretch in an otherwise sinious waterway; in modern sailing the distance to be sailed between two points). So the word means “the straight passage at Skagen”.<ref>''Svenskt ortsnamnslexikon'' (Swedish lexicon of placenames).</ref>
