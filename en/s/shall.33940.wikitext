====Usage notes====
* Historically, '''shall''' is the present tense and '''[[should]]''' is its past tense.
: ''You have done that you '''should''' be sorry for.''
: ''You have done that you '''shall''' be sorry for.''

* In the past, '''will''' and '''shall''' have been used similarly as auxiliary verbs for the future tense. The simple future tense traditionally uses '''shall''' for the first person ("I" and "we"), and '''will''' for the second and third persons.
: ''I '''shall''' go.''
: ''You will go.''

* An emphatic future tense, with a sense of '''must''', reverses the two words, using '''will''' for the first person and '''shall''' for the second and third person.
: ''I will go.''
: ''You '''shall''' go.''

* Usage can be reversed in questions and in dependent clauses&mdash;especially with indirect discourse. For example: ''Shall you do it?'' is equivalent in meaning to ''Will you do it?'' as it anticipates your response ''I shall do it.'' Or: ''he says that he shall win'' or ''he expects that he shall win'' report his saying ''I shall win'', not ''I will win.''

* '''Shall''' is rarely used in modern American English, '''will''' being the preferred auxiliary verb for the future tense.  When '''shall''' ''is'' used, it is often to give a sense of mocking arrogance.
