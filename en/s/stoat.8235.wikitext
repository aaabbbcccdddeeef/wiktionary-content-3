===Etymology===
mid-15c., ''[[stote]]'', ("the ermine, especially in its brown summer coat"), of uncertain origin. The word bears resemblance to Old Norse ''[[stutr]]'' ("bull"), Swedish ''[[stut]]'' ("bull"), Danish ''[[stud]]'' ("ox"), but the sense is difficult unless a common notion is "male animal".
