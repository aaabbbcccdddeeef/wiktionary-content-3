# {{taxlink|Mustela erminea|species|noshow=1}}, the [[ermine]] or short-tailed [[weasel]], a [[mustelid]] native to [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]], distinguished from the [[least weasel]] by its larger size and longer tail with a prominent black tip.
#* '''1886''', ''Transactions of the Edinburgh Naturalists' Field Club'', Volume 1, [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ikRKAAAAYAAJ&q=%22stoat%22%7C%22stoats%22&dq=%22stoat%22%7C%22stoats%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4Tk0U63NJYX3lAWaz4H4Cw&redir_esc=y page 135],
#*: I have never seen '''Stoats''' hunt in packs, but it is certain both Weasels and '''Stoats''' do so.

#*: In 1953 it was reported that the '''stoat''' had increased to a high population level, but that the weasel introduced at the same time had disappeared (de Vos ''et al.'' 1956).
