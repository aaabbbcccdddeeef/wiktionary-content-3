[[File:Mustela erminea upright.jpg|right|thumb|A '''stoat''']]

===Etymology===
{{defdate|Mid 1400s}}, from {{inh|en|enm|stote||the ermine, especially in its brown summer coat}}, of uncertain origin. The word bears some resemblance to {{cog|non|stutr||bull}}, {{cog|sv|stut||bull, [[steer]]}} and {{cog|da|stud||ox}} (see also {{cog|en|stot}}), but the semantic link is difficult unless a common origin is from “(brown?) male mammal”.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|en|/ˈstəʊt/}}
* {{rhymes|en|əʊt}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{m|mul|Mustela erminea}}, the [[ermine]] or short-tailed [[weasel]], a [[mustelid]] native to [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]], distinguished from the [[least weasel]] by its larger size and longer tail with a prominent black tip.
