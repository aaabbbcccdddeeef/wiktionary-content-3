A '''sneakerhead''' by definition is a person who owns multiple pairs of shoes as a form of collection and fashion.  It is often manifest by the use of shoes primarily made for sports such as tennis or basketball as normal everyday clothing.  The birth of sneakerhead culture came in the late 1980's and can be attributed to two major sources.  These contributing factors were basketball and the Hip-Hop movement in music.  The boom of signature basketball shoes in the late 1980's provided the shear numbers and multiple varieties necessary to birth such a subculture while the Hip-Hop movement gave sneakers their street value as status symbols. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/14/AR2007011400451_2.html|publisher=The Washington Post|title=Sneakerheads love to show off shoes|accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>
