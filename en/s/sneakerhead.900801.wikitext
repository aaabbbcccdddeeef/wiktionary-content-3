== Sneakerhead/Hypebeast ==

A sneakerhead by social definition is an individual who conforms to that particular style of dressing and shopping. This style, arguably birthed in 2002 with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s official release of their new skateboarding line, [[Nike Skateboarding]], is celebrated by many teenagers and young adults in America, particularly those who live in urban milieu. Based on the premise of incessant shopping, these people are most saliently marked by their raiment, such as [[Levi's]] hard-denim jeans, [[Nudies]] jeans, [[Nike SB]]s, thick framed eye wear from such companies as [[Versace]], and hoodies from [[A Bathing Ape]]. It is a [[subculture]] based on hype, or in economic terms,[[demand]], meaning that the items garnering the highest demand, whether it be through price or availability, will become rare and eventually resellable on the market with the seller appropriating substantial profits. A maxim frequently said by members of this culture is that they are anti-fashion and attempt to step beyond the boundaries of societal norms, even [[bohemian]] in essence. Such claims have lose their verisimilitude when a small subculture becomes a preponderate mode of fashion. Those who surmount the rest at this game are known as hypebeasts, buying everything that might be of worth. Some stores that cater to this culture can be found at:[http://freshnessmag.com/v4/new-york-city-shop-guide/].
