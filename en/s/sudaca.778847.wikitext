==Spanish==

===Etymology===
Sudaca is a colloquial term, used as a short way to call people from South American origin mostly in Spain. 
The term became dark and xenophobic in the '70s and '80s during an era called la Movida Madrile√±a due to the massive waves of Southamerican immigrants to Spain. Nowadays, all over the world, people feel proud to be called Sudaca, and unfortunately, some others don't.
