Panchito and Payopony

====Usage notes====
A Spanish colloquial term used most typically in Spain to denote all people from Latin America in a derogatory or pejorative way. Initially, Sudaca refered to Mestizo Latin Americans with Amerindian features since the majority of immigrants were mestizos. However, as more White Latin Americans immigrated Sudaca evolved to denote White Latin American with European features, who speak with an accented Spanish and are culturally different from the local Spaniards. More recently Spaniards tend to call a white Latino - Sudaca and a Mestizo Latino - Panchito or Payopony. The term Sudaca is believed to have originated during the popular [[Movida madrile√±a]] (Madrid Movement) in the 1980s as a result of Latin American Immigration. Due to the rapid influx of Mestizo Latin American culturally diverse White immigrants to Spain from the early 1990s to present, the word has evolved into a common, yet highly offensive ethnic slur due to the fact that most Spaniards felt that the Latinos have competed successfully in the blue collar job market by working for less and had indirectly contributed to the lowering of the blue collar wage scales for Spaniards. Before the 1980s the more polite way of addressing the Latin American immigrants to Spain would be to call them collectively Latinos.
