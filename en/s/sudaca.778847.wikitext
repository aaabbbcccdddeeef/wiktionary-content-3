==Spanish==

===Etymology===
It's believed to have originated during the popular [[Movida madrile√±a]](Madrid Movement) in the 1980s and due to Latin American Immigration. Poor and desparate these people are consistently exploited as cheap labor in agriculture as well as domestic employees in Madrid, Barcelona and other major Spanish cities. The term became derogatory when the middle and lower class Spaniard found that the majority of Latinos who came to Spain were very poor with no skills and were willing to work very hard for little or no money to stay in the country causing them to compete with Spanairds for employment in blue collar jobes. 
In Spain the word Sudaca is a coruption of the spanish word for South American (SUD AmeriCAno)., derivated as a derogative term which can be offensive in social contexts.
