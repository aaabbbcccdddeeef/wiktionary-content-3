# {{sense|normally considered offensive and vulgar}} Latin American

====Usage notes====
A Spanish colloquial term used strictly in Spain to denote people from Latin America in a derogatory way. Usually used by Caucasian Spanish xenophobes in Spain to denote Latin American immigrants or people born in Spain with degrees of [[Amerindian]] racial features. It can also be used by ordinary Spaniards to denote Latin Americans with caucasoid racial features found to be associated with criminal acts or who have a noticeable Latin American Spanish accent. 
The term is believed to have originated during the popular [[Movida madrile√±a]] (Madrid Movement) in the 1980s as a result of Latin American Immigration. The term became derogatory when the middle and lower class Spaniard found that the majority of Latinos who came to Spain were very poor with no skills and were willing to work very hard for little or no money to stay in the country, causing them to compete with Spaniards for employment in blue collar jobs.
