# {{context|offensive|derogatory|vulgar|slang|lang=es}} Latin American

====Usage notes====
A Spanish colloquial term used most typically in Spain to denote people from Latin America in a derogatory or pejorative way. The term is associated with immigrants from Latin America with [[Amerindian]] physical features and who speak with accented Spanish of varied origins and is believed to have originated during the popular [[Movida madrile√±a]] (Madrid Movement) in the 1980s as a result of Latin American Immigration. Due to the rapid influx of Latin American immigrants to Spain from the early 1990s to present, the word has evolved into a common, yet highly offensive ethnic slur.
