# {{context|netball|lang=en}} A pass of the ball between teammates too close together to allow an opponent to get between them. There is no particular distance the ball must travel to qualify as a short pass.  For instance, if the passing player drops the ball and retreats before her teammate takes possession, it is not a short pass.  A short pass is against the rules and results in a [[free pass]] to the opposition.
