{{en-noun|sg=[[short]] [[pass]]}}
# {{netball}} A pass of the ball between teammates too close together to allow an opponent to get between them.  (There's no particular distance the ball must travel, so for instance the passing player can drop the ball and retreat before her teammate takes posession and that's not a short pass.)  A short pass is against the rules and results in a [[penalty pass]] to the opposition.
