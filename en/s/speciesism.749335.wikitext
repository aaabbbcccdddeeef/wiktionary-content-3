#* {{quote-book|passage=Such is the breathtaking '''speciesism''' of our Christian-inspired attitudes, the abortion of a single human zygote (most of them are destined to be spontaneously aborted anyway) can arouse more moral solicitude and righteous indignation than the vivisection of any number of intelligent adult chimpanzees|author=Richard Dawkins|title=The Blind Watchmaker|publisher=W.

# A prejudical perspective that denies that all living beings are innately endowed with the will to live, even the one-celled organism. Speciesism divides living beings into classes and removes the right for the organism to enjoy continued and unimpeded existence without intervention or disruption or cessation on the part of the ignorance, misunderstanding, or nescience of the human being. A fundemental belief that dominion and control over oranisms is equivocal to a grant of death rights or privileges having moral and spiritual support. Practice of speciesism reflects a lower state of consciousness.
