===Etymology 1===
From a merger of two verbs:
* {{inh|en|enm|setlen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|setlan|t=to settle, seat, put to rest}}, from {{der|en|ang|setl||seat}} (compare {{cog|nl|zetelen||to be established, settle}}) and
* {{inh|en|enm|sahtlen}}, {{m|enm|seihtlen|t=to reconcile, calm, subside}}, from {{inh|en|ang|sahtlian}}, {{m|ang|ġesehtlian|t=to reconcile}}, from {{der|en|ang|saht}}, {{m|ang|seht|t=settlement, agreement, reconciliation, peace}} (see {{m|en|saught}}, {{m|en|-le}}).

{{m+|de|siedeln|t=to settle}} is related to the former of the two verbs, but is not an immediate cognate of either of them.
