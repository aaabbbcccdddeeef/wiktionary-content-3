==English==

===Etymology===
Latin ''[[super]]'', over + ''[[sedere]]'', to sit, via Middle French ''superceder'', originally in the meaning "postpone, defer". The meaning "to replace" is from 1642, probably by association with [[precede]].

===Transitive verb===
{{en-infl-reg-other-e|supersed|e}}

# To set (something) aside.
# To take the place of.
# To [[displace]] in favour of another.

====Usage notes====
*The correct spelling of this word is '''supersede'''.  '''Supercede''' is commonly seen, by analogy with  "precede" and other terms built from [[cedere]], etc., but this is a misspelling.

====Synonyms====
*[[replace]], [[supplant]], [[usurp]]
