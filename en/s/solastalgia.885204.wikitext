# A form of [[homesick]]ness one gets when one is still at home, but the [[environment]] is changed.
#* {{quote-book|en|year=2010|author=Albert Bates|title=The Biochar Solution: Carbon Farming and Climate Change|publisher=New Society Publishers|ISBN=9781550924596|passage=
There are many people writing and talking about extinction now, and about '''solastalgia''', the psychic or existential distress caused by environmental change.  Artists, musicians, dancers, and screenwriters are wringing profound '''solastalgia''' from the recesses of our collective subconscious and spinning its trajectory out into the light where we can get a better sense of it.}}
