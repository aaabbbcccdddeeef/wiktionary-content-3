=====Usage notes=====
* The alternative past tense and past participle form "[[slayed]]" is most strongly associated with the slang sense, "to delight or overwhelm":
*: {{cite-book|i2=*::|1929|Harry Charles Witwer|Yes Man's Land|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3K1EAAAAIAAJ|page=254
|passage="Cutey, you '''slayed''' me !" grins Jackie, working fast. "I guess that's what made the rest of 'em look so bad — you was so good!"}}
* In recent use, "slayed" is also often found associated with the other senses as well. However, this is widely considered nonstandard.<ref>{{cite-book|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&pg=PA853&dq=%2Bslayed|isbn=0877791325|author=Merriam-Webster Publishing Co.|page=853|chapter=slay|year=1994|passage=But ''slayed'' cannot be considered established in such use. Whether it eventually becomes established remains to be seen.}}</ref>
* A review of US usage 2000-2009 in COCA suggests that "slayed" is increasing in popularity, but remains less common than "slew". It is very rare in UK usage (BNC).
* "Slain" has a current usage in newspaper headlines, as being shorter than "murdered".
