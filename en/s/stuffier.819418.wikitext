#* {{quote-journal|en|year=1941|month=August|author=C. Hamilton Ellis|title=The English Station|journal=Railway Magazine|page=358|text=If Euston is not typically English, St. Pancras is. Its fa√ßade is a nightmare of improbable Gothic. It is fairly plastered with the aesthetic ideals of 1868, and the only beautiful thing about it is Barlow's roof. It is haunted by the '''stuffier''' kind of ghost. Yet there is ''something'' about the ordered whole of St. Pancras that would make demolition a terrible pity.}}
