===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|idiomatic}} A [[phrase]] [[frequently]] or [[habitually]] used by a person or group, and thus [[associated]] with them.
#: ''Bart Simpson's '''stock phrase''' "I didn't do it" was once lampooned on the show itself.''

should also mean a word for both idioms and standard adjective noun combinations, since there isn't currently a word for this group, but stock phrase is shorter than standard phrase even though standard phrase currently doesn't mean anything

stock phrase wouldn't mean cliche based on this meaning (it really should not mean cliche because stock means off the shelf and phrase means groups of words meaning something, and together they would mean off the shelf group of words meaning something, which is not cliche at all, but instead meaningful)
