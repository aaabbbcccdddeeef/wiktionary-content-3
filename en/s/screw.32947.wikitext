[[File:Screws.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Various '''screws'''.]]
[[File:Screw-Konpira.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ship '''screw'''.]]

===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|screw}}, {{m|enm|scrue|t=screw}}; apparently, despite the difference in meaning, from {{der|en|fro|escroue|t=nut, cylindrical socket, screwhole}}, of {{unk.|en|title=uncertain}} origin. There is also the {{cog|fro|escruve|t=screw}}, from {{cog|odt|*scrūva}} {{gloss|"screw"; whence {{cog|dum|schruyve|t=screw}}}}, which probably influenced or conflated with the aforementioned, resulting in the Middle English word.
{{rel-top|more on the etymology of ''screw''}}
Old French {{m|fro|escroue}} (whence {{cog|ML.|scrofa||nut, screwhole}}), is believed to be an adaptation of {{etyl|la|en}} {{m|la|scrōfa||sow, female pig}};<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 11th edn., s.v. "screw".</ref> but this development is not found in other Romance languages.<ref>''A new English dictionary on historical principles, Vol. 8, "screw"''</ref> (For change in meaning, compare also Spanish {{m|es|puerca}}, Portuguese {{m|pt|porca}}, both ‘sow; screw nut’, and is based on the fact that a [[boar]]'s penis has a screw-like tip, making the sow's [[vulva]] equivalent to a screw nut by [[analogy]]).

Old Dutch {{m|odt|*scrūva}} possibly derives from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*skrūbō||screw}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*skru-||to cut}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*(s)keru-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*(s)ker-||to cut}}, and is related to {{cog|de|Schraube||screw}}, {{cog|nds|schruve}}, {{m|nds|schruwe||screw}}, {{cog|nl|schroef||screw}}, {{cog|fy|skroef||screw}}, {{cog|da|skrue||screw}}, {{cog|sv|skruv||screw, peg}}, {{cog|is|skrúfa||screw}}.

Compare also Occitan {{m|oc|escrofa||screw nut}}, Calabrese {{m|it|scrufina||screw nut}}, which may be borrowings of the Old French word, or parallel developments. <!--Are these natural developments from a Latin ancestor term, or are they merely borrowing the French word or usage??? -->
