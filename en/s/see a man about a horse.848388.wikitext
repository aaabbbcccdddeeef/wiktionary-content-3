From the 1866 [[w:Dion Boucicault|Dion Boucicault]] play, ''Flying Scud'', in which a character knowingly breezes past a difficult situation saying, "Excuse me Mr. Quail, I can't stop; I've got to see a man about a dog."

====Usage notes====
* The most common variation is to "see a man about a horse".
* Almost any noun can be substituted as a way of giving the hearer a hint about one's purpose in departing.
* The inversion to "see a dog about a man" eliminates any lingering uncertainty about whether the hearer is being put off.
* A shorter variant is to "see a man".
