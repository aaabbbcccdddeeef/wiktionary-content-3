==See a Man (about a dog or about a horse)==
'''To see a man, to see a man about a dog, or to see a man about a horse''' is usually a smiling apology for one's departure or absence, used as a bland euphemism to conceal one's true purpose.  The phrase has several meanings but all refer to taking one's leave for some urgent purpose, especially to go to the bathroom or going to buy a drink.  During Prohibition, "to see a man about a dog" often meant to go meet one's bootlegger.  The phrase "see a dog about a man" is also sometimes used.
