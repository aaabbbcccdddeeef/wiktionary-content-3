===Etymology===
Commonly claimed to have come from:
*[[w:King James Version of the Bible|King James Version of the Bible]], [[w:Book of Proverbs|Book of Proverbs]], [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#Chapter 13|13:24]]
*: "He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."

Due to the associated "spoil" concept which is not in the bible, it more likely came from:

*A 17th century poem by Samuel Butler called “Hudibras”.  In the poem, a love affair is likened to a child, and spanking is commended as a way to make the love grow stronger.  The actual verse reads[[http://gracethrufaith.com/selah/spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child/]]:
*:"What medicine else can cure the fits<br />
*:Of lovers when they lose their wits?<br />
*:Love is a boy by poets styled<br />
*:Then spare the rod and spoil the child."

From the Latin, the text uses the word 'virga' which can mean either a twig, sprout, stalk, switch, rod, staff, wand, or scepter. <br>

For the Hebrew text, the word for "rod" in these verses is shebet which includes the following meanings :-<br>
1. rod, staff, <br>
2. branch, offshoot, twig<br>
3. shaft (of spear, dart)<br>
4. club (of shepherd's implement) or crook<br>
5. truncheon, sceptre (mark of authority)<br>
6. clan, tribe <br>

===Arguments about this issue===

The majority of westerm governments now have laws against corporal punishment; even so, a significant number of states in the USA (21) still allow beating with a wooden board sufficient to raise bruises and break the skin. <br>

There are groups such as No Greater Joy Ministries which strongly endorse the benefits of not 'sparing the rod'.  A quote from their website offers: "Spanking at any age should only be administered by those who have a proper philosophy of spanking."<br>
There are other groups which equally strongly believe such parental behaviour is wrong. Both parties can and do supply evidence which they affirm supports their views. <br>
