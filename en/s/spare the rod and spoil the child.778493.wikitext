===Etymology===
Commonly claimed to have come from:
*[[w:King James Version of the Bible|King James Version of the Bible]], [[w:Book of Proverbs|Book of Proverbs]], [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#Chapter 13|13:24]]
*: "He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."

Due to the associated "spoil" concept which is not in the bible, it more likely came from:

*A 17th century poem by Samuel Butler called “Hudibras”.  In the poem, a love affair is likened to a child, and spanking is commended as a way to make the love grow stronger.  The actual verse reads[[http://gracethrufaith.com/selah/spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child/]]:
*:"What medicine else can cure the fits<br />
*:Of lovers when they lose their wits?<br />
*:Love is a boy by poets styled<br />
*:Then spare the rod and spoil the child."
