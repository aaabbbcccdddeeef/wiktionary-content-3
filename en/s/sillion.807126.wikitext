#*: My tiller cut easily in the moist ground, and the weeds of winter and early spring easily yielded to the tines. Gerard Manly Hopkins wrote that there is “no wonder” that “sheer plod makes plough down '''sillion''' shine” — but the fact is, Mr. Hopkins, that there is in spring great wonder in the glimmer of “'''sillion'''” falling off the plough. And that wonder takes the “sheer plod” from my feet. <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[¶]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> That is quite the reverse for the gardener who churns under his failed crops in August. In dust, there is no '''sillion''', and that work in hot summer sun is the sheerest of plod.
