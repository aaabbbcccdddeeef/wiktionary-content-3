==English==
[[image:Heptagon.svg|thumb|A [[regular]] septagon]]

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|proscribed}} A [[polygon]] with seven sides and seven [[angle]]s.

===Usage notes===
Because '''septagon''' is formed by combining {{der|en|la|septem||seven}}, with {{der|en|grc|γωνία||angle}}, it is considered by many to be inferior to the normal synonym [[heptagon]], which has a fully Greek etymology.
