===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{label|en|proscribed}} A [[polygon]] with seven sides and seven [[angle]]s; a [[heptagon]].

===Usage notes===
Because '''septagon''' is formed by combining Latin [[septem]], seven, with Greek [[γωνία]] (gonia), angle, it is considered by many to be very much inferior to the normal synonym [[heptagon]] which has a fully Greek etymology.
