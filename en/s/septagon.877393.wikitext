===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|proscribed}} A [[polygon]] with seven sides and seven [[angle]]s; a [[heptagon]].

===Usage notes===
Because '''heptagon''' is formed by combining Latin [[heptem]], seven, with Greek [[γωνία]] (gonia), angle, it is considered by many to be inferior to the normal synonym [[heptagon]], which has a fully Greek etymology.
