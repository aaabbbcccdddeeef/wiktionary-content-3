#A [[television]] [[serial]], typically broadcast in the afternoon or evening, about the lives of [[melodramatic]] characters, which are often filled with strong [[emotion]]s, highly dramatic situations and [[suspense]].

Note: Soap operas earned their name (soap) from the consistent soap and detergent commercials during the shows that were aimed at women who were cleaning their house at the time of viewing. (Opera) comes from the fact that the shows were so melodramatic.
