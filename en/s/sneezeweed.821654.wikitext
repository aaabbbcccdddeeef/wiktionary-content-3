#*: '''Centipeda''' Two species of '''sneezeweed''' are found in wet places, often at the fringes of wetlands where they may be flooded during heavy rain. ''C. cunninghamii'' is the larger plant, an upright perennial with coarsely toothed leaves up to 3 cm long; it is found through much of eastern Australia other than Tasmania.
#*: ''C. minima'' is a sprawling annual with leaves less than 1 cm long, smooth-edged or sometimes with a few blunt teeth. This is a widespread plant found across much of non-tropical Australia. Both species are strongly and pleasantly aromatic, and have been used in the treatment of colds and infected eyes or throats.
