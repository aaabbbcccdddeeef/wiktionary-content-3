==English==

===Etymology===
The term was given to the military training cartoon character, Private Snafu, by Frank Capra in 1942.  The stories were written by Theodor Geisel (a.k.a. Dr. Seuss), and Snafu's voice was done by Mel Blanc.  It is not clear whether the term existed before that.

In 1941, Don Taylor and his buddy Johnny Paup of the Army Signal Corps were making words out of five-letter code groups. SNAFU was one of those groups.
