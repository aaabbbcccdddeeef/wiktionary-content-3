{{en-noun|sg=[[simple]] [[past]]|-}}

# {{grammar}} A [[tense]] that allows you to describe something that happened in the past.  It is "simple" because it is formed by inflection of a single word: there is no auxiliary verb such as ''be'' or ''have'' (unlike the [[present perfect]] and [[past perfect]] tenses).  The simple past tense is also called the ''preterite'' (occasionally ''preterit'') tense, especially when referring to foreign languages.  It is also known more simply as just the [[past tense]].
