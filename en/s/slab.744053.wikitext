A '''slab''' in this context is a heavily modified car.  This term is used predominantly among young [[blacks]] in the Southern United [[States]].  

This term was popularised in the recent [[Borat]] movie, where the titular character after having spent time with ghetto youths in [[Atlanta]], utters at the hotel where he wanted to stay, with his pants sagging, "What's up wit it vanillaface . . . Me and my homeboy just parked our slab outside and are looking to post up our black asses for the night.  Bang Bang, Skeet Skeet, Nigger!"
