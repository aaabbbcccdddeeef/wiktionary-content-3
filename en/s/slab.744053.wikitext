A '''slab''' in this context is a heavily modified car.  This term is used predominantly among young [[blacks]] in the Southern United [[States]].  

This term was popularised in the recent [[Borat]] movie, where the titular character utters at the hotel, with his pants sagging, "Me and my homeboy parked our slab outside and are looking to post up our black asses for the night."
