A '''slab''' in this context is a heavily modified car. Slab is an acronym for Slow Loud And Bangin/Banging. This term is used predominantly among young [[blacks]] in the Southern United [[States]].  

This term was popularised in the recent [[Borat]] movie, where the titular character after having spent time with ghetto youths in [[Atlanta]], utters at the hotel where he wanted to stay, with his pants sagging, "What's up wit it vanillaface . . . Me and my homeboy Azamat just parked our slab outside and are looking to post up our black asses for the night.  Bang Bang, Skeet Skeet, Nigger!"

In this context, the term '''slab''' refers to a car that has been modified with equipment such as loud speakers, lights, special paint, hydraulics, and any other accessories that add to the style of the vehicle. "Slab" is an acronym for "Slow, Loud And Bangin'." The word (and, of course, the vehicle(s) themselves) has been popularized through the [[Southern rap]] genre of hip-hop, most notably by rappers  such as [[Paul Wall]], [[Chamillionaire]], [[Lil' Keke]], and others.
