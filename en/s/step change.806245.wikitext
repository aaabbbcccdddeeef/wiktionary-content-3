In common usage a '''step change''' happens when a situation changes in a discontinuous way: a big policy  change after an election, a currency devaluation, the discovery of gold at Sutters mill for example. That is to say, a change like a step in an otherwise smooth graph.

This concept has been borrowed from mathematics and technology where the phrase [[step function]] is rigoursly defined.
