In common usage a '''step change''' happens when a situation [[change]]s in a [[discontinuous]] way: a big [[policy]]  change after an election, a currency devaluation, the discovery of gold at Sutters mill for example. That is to say, a change like a step in an otherwise smooth graph.

This concept has been borrowed from mathematics and technology where the phrase [[step function]] is rigorously defined.

[[Catastrophe theory]] is one mathematical theory used to explain step changes.

In business often referred to as a significant change in direction or shift in paradigm. Step Change in business language has a positive connotation meaning that the change associated with a Step Change does not only require significant efforts to achieve it but more importantly leads to increased value or returns.
