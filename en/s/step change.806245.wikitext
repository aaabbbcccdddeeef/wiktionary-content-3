In common usage a '''step change''' happens when a situation [[change]]s in a [[discontinuous]] way: a big [[policy]] change after an election, a currency devaluation, or the discovery of gold at Sutters Mill, for example. That is to say, a change like a step in an otherwise smooth graph.
The concept has been borrowed from mathematics and technology where the phrase [[step function]] is rigorously defined. 

'Step Change' is sometimes considered to be [[management speak]] and to have replaced 'Quantum Leap' within today's business world. 
[[Catastrophe theory]] is one mathematical theory used to explain step changes.
