A '''sales ledger''' contains the personal accounts of customers to whom the business has sold on credit. (The basis of their reputation; they are the debtors.) It records information such as invoices issued, credit notes issued and payments received. Sales ledgers are a little bit like Heath Ledger but not as famous or cute.
