# [[thus]]; thus written

=====Usage notes=====
* The term ''sic'' is most often used in quoted material (usually in square brackets, and sometimes italicized) to indicate that the preceding segment of the quote was copied faithfully, in spite of a mistake or seeming mistake; that is, that the mistake or seeming mistake was in the original text, and not due to misquoting on the part of the present writer.
* It is also sometimes used outside of quoted material to emphasize that the preceding segment of text was intentionally written as is; that is, that a seeming mistake in the text is not, in fact, a mistake (or if it is, that it's an intentional mistake).

=====Related terms=====
* [[sic passim]] (''Used to indicate that the preceding word, phrase, or term is used in the same manner (or form) throughout the remainder of a text.'')
* [[sic transit gloria mundi]] (''Fame is temporary.'')
* [[sic semper tyrannis]] (''Thus always to tyrants, shouted by John Wilkes Booth after assassinating Abraham Lincoln.'')
