#* '''1999''', Raneta Lawson Mack, ''A Layperson's Guide to Criminal Law'', Greenwood Publishing Group ({{ISBN|9780313305566}}), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYgKO18W-eIC&lpg=PA72&dq=%22statutory%20rape%22&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q=%22statutory%20rape%22&f=false page 72]:
#*: Historically, '''statutory rape''' laws were enacted to protect the chastity and morality of young women. These statutes made it a crime for a man to have sexual intercourse with a young woman under a certain age (usually eighteen), even if the young woman consented to the act. (Today of, course, '''statuory rape''' provisions protect minors of both genders.)

====Usage notes====
Technically, the term ''statutory rape'' is not usually used by governments or states in their laws. It is a term used to simply describe the laws against adults having sex with people younger than the government's legal age for sex or other adults who are intellectually disabled.
