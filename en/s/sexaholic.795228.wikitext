The sexaholics have taken themselves out of the whole context of what is right or wrong. They have lost control, no longer have the power of choice, and are not free to stop. Lust has become an addiction. Their situation is like that of the alcoholic who can no longer tolerate alcohol and must stop drinking altogether but is hooked and cannot stop. So it is with the sexaholic, or sex drunk, who can no longer tolerate lust but cannot stop.

For the sexaholic, any form of sex with one's self or with partners other than the spouse is progressively addictive and destructive. Lust is the driving force behind sexual acting out, and true sobriety includes progressive victory over lust.
