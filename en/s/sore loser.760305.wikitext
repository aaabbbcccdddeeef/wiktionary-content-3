|text=Regarding the criticism of Al Gore's actions upon being elected president in 2000 and realizing that the Bush family would do everything in its power to reverse the results illegally: I recall at the time hearing some of the usual morons in this country refer to President-elect Gore as a '''sore loser''' because he sought legal redress in the courts.<br>'''Sore loser'''? You bet your fuckin' ass! What on earth is wrong with being a '''sore loser'''? It shows you cared about whatever the contest was in the first place. Fuck losing graciously—that's for chumps. And losers, by the way.}}
