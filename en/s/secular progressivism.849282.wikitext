===Noun===
#An alleged movement in the [[United States]] with the ostensible goal of removing [[religion]] from the [[public sphere]]. Probably coined by "Papa Bear" Bill O'Reilly in his ongoing feud with the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', ''Des Moines Register'' and ''Idaho Statesman'' over the use of the [[NPOV]] term "holiday tree" in place of "Christmas tree", it has since gained some traction among both conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and John Gibson and those (such as the ''Boston Globe'' columnist who criticized O'Reilly and was called a secular progressive or "SP" for his trouble) alleged to be members of the movement (as a badge of pride in the way [[Oakie]] is used by those from Oklahoma).
