===Noun===
'''stole'''

# an ecclesiastical garment.
#*Certain robes indicate a position in the hierarchy; others correspond to function and may be worn by the same individual at different times. The most important [[vestment]] among the insignia [of the clergy] is the '''stole''', the emblem of [[sacerdotal]] status, the origin of which is the ancient pallium. The '''stole''' originally was a draped garment, then a folded one with the appearance of a scarf, and, finally, in the 4th century, a scarf. As a symbol of jurisdiction in the Roman Empire, the supreme pontiff (the pope, or bishop of Rome) conferred it upon [[archbishop]]s and, later, upon bishops, as emblematic of their sharing in the papal authority.
