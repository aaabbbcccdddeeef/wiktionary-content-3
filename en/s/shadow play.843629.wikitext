help me out here....
.
I hear this term in some English lyrics and speech....

A meaningless act? A pointless, but beautiful, action??

Does it refer to shadow puppets, butterflies made from the shadow of hands, as a analogy to the fleeting games we all play in life??
Or those actors behind a screen with their shadows projected for the audience .. but the same analogy???

I feel the sense of the word but, well, maybe I'm just better off with my own internal, non-verbal, meaning. 

phhhtp!
