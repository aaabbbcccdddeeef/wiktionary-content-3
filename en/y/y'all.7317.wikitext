===Alternative forms===
* [[ya'll]]  Though "y'all" has gained acceptance through common usage, "ya'll" is the correct spelling. Contractions are formed when the phonology of a word obviates a sound in a word that follows. A word not yet uttered does not change the form of the word that precedes it. Thus it is the second word in a contraction that is abbreviated. For instance, "you" maintains its full form in "you've," and "you're." The word "ya'll" isn't "you" plus "all," which would take the form "you'll." Rather, "ya'll" is "ya" plus "all." One can ask a single person, "Where are ya going," but to include a second person, one would say, "Where are ya'll going?" The apostrophe in "ya'll" represents the phonologically redundant "a" that was elided from "all."

* [[you all]]

====Usage notes====
*Used to refer to more than one person; when addressed to only one person, it refers to that person and others not present.
*The form {{term|y'all}} is heard primarily in the South of the United States and nationwide in [[AAVE]], while {{term|youse}} is heard primarily in various parts of the Northern United States, particularly Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.
*Notwithstanding its etymology, the {{term|all}} in {{term|y’all}} is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier. Thus, just as {{term|us}} may refer either to ''some of us'' or ''all of us'' in standard English, {{term|y’all}} may refer either to ''some of y’all'' or to ''all [of] y’all.''
