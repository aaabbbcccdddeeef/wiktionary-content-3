|passage=People in the South do indeed seem to be addressing a single person as "'''y'all'''." For instance, a restaurant patron might ask a waiter, "What '''y'all''' got for dessert tonight?" In that case, "'''y'all'''" refers collectively to the people who run the restaurant.}}

====Usage notes====
* The form {{term|y'all|lang=en}} is heard primarily in the Southern United States, and nationwide in [[AAVE]], while {{term|youse|lang=en}} is heard in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, particularly Philadelphia.
*In the past, ''y'all'' was never used as a proper singular, but it may have been used where there is an implied plural, e.g. "you [and your team]", "you [and your coworkers]", "you [and your family]". Due to a cultural shift in the United States by non-Southerners using the word, it is sometimes used as a singular ''you''.<ref name="singular">{{cite web| last =Okrent| first =Anrika| date = 2014-09-14| url =http://theweek.com/article/index/267886/can-yall-be-used-to-refer-to-a-single-person| title = Can y'all be used to refer to a single person? | work =The Week | publisher =The Week Publications| language =English | accessdate =2014-09-15}}</ref>
* Notwithstanding its etymology, the {{term|all|lang=en}} in {{term|y'all|lang=en}} is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier. Thus, just as {{term|us|lang=en}} may refer either to ''some of us'' or ''all of us'' in standard English, {{term|y'all|lang=en}} may refer either to ''some of '''y'all''''' or to ''all [of] '''y'all'''.''
