====Usage notes====
===Usage notes===
*In US South usage, '''you all''' or '''y'all''' is used to address either more than one person, or one person whom the speaker does not know personally or well, or who is much older or as a sign of respect for the person's position or seniority. '''You all''' or '''y'all''' may also be used even for a single person the speaker knows well, but in a formal environment such as a classroom or when asking a question at a public meeting. This usage is very consistent with the French [[vous]].
*Many US Southerners will deny that '''you all''' or '''y'all''' is ever properly used in the singular, but rather it appears to be used that way occasionally when there is an "implied" plural you (a "corporate" you, a "team" you, or "you and your family", "you and your friends" (who aren't here right now), "you and your party", etc.).
*The form {{term|y'all}} is heard primarily in the South of the United States and nationwide in [[AAVE]], while {{term|youse}} is heard primarily in various parts of the Northern United States, particularly Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.
*Notwithstanding its etymology, the {{term|all}} in {{term|y’all}} is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier. Thus, just as {{term|us}} may refer either to ''some of us'' or ''all of us'' in standard English, {{term|y’all}} may refer either to ''some of y’all'' or to ''all [of] y’all.''

====Synonyms====
* {{sense|plural you}} [[you's]] {{i|rare}}, [[youse]], [[you'se]] {{i|New York, Australian, slang}}, [[you guys]], [[you-uns]] {{i|rural|rural, Midwestern and Appalachian US; slang}}
