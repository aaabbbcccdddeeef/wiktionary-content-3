===Pronunciation===
*{{IPA|/jɑːl/}}

===Pronoun===
'''[[y]][[']][[all]]''' (''possessive:'' '''[[y'all's]]'''), also '''[[you all]]'''

# (''mainly southern US; colloquial'') The plural of [[you]]. Used to refer to more than one person; when addressed to only one person, it refers to that person and others not present.

====Synonyms====
*[[you's]] ''rare'', [[youse]], [[you'se]] (''New York'', ''Australian''; ''slang'')
*[[you guys]]

====Usage notes====
The form ''y'all'' is seen primarily in the South of the United States and nationwide in [[AAVE]], while ''youse'' is seen primarily in various parts of the Northern United States, particularly Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.

Notwithstanding its etymology, the ''all'' in ''y’all'' is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier. Thus, just as ''us'' may refer either to ''some of us'' or ''all of us'' in standard English, ''y’all'' may refer either to ''some of y’all'' or to ''all [of] y’all.''
