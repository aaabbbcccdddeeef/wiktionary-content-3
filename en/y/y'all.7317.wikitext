====Usage notes====
* Many Southerners argue that ''you all'' or ''y'all'' is never properly used in the singular, but only when there is an implied plural (e.g. "you and your team" or "you and your family").
* Others suggest that ''you all'' or ''y'all'' is used to address either more than one person, or one person whom the speaker does not know personally or well, or who is much older or as a sign of respect for the person's position or seniority, and that ''y'all'' may also be used even for a single person the speaker knows well but in a formal environment such as a classroom or town meeting. This usage would be consistent with the French usage of ''[[vous]]''. {{Citation needed}}
* The form {{term|y'all|lang=en}} is heard primarily in the Southern United States, and nationwide in [[AAVE]], while {{term|youse|lang=en}} is heard primarily in various parts of the Northern United States, particularly Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.
* Notwithstanding its etymology, the {{term|all|lang=en}} in {{term|y'all|lang=en}} is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier. Thus, just as {{term|us|lang=en}} may refer either to ''some of us'' or ''all of us'' in standard English, {{term|y'all|lang=en}} may refer either to ''some of '''y'all''''' or to ''all [of] '''y'all'''.''
