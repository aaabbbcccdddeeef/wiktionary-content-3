====Usage notes====
The form ''y'all'' is seen primarily in the South of the United States and nationwide in [[AAVE]], while ''youse'' is seen primarily in various parts of the Northern United States, particularly Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.

Notwithstanding its etymology, the ''all'' in ''y'all'' is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier.  Thus, just as ''us'' may refer either to ''some of us'' or ''all of us'' in standard English, ''y'all'' may refer either to ''some of y'all'' or to ''all [of] y'all.''
