====Usage notes====
* The form {{m|en|y'all}} is heard primarily in the Southern United States, and nationwide in [[AAVE]]. Recently, the form has begun to be used by other American English speakers as well, though still less commonly than {{m|en|you guys}}.<ref name="mel" /> For other second-personal plural pronouns, see '''{{m|en|you}}'''.
* In the past, ''y'all'' was never used as a proper singular, but it may have been used with an implied plural, e.g. "you [and your team]," "you [and your coworkers]," "you [and your family]." Due to a cultural shift in the United States by non-Southerners using the word, it is now rarely also used as a singular ''you'',<ref name="singular">{{cite-web|last=Okrent|first=Arika|date=2014-09-14|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/267886/can-yall-be-used-to-refer-to-a-single-person|title=Can y'all be used to refer to a single person?|work=The Week|publisher=The Week Publications|lang=en|accessdate=2014-09-15}}</ref> although most (increasing) non-Southern / non-AAVE use is, like Southern and AAVE use, plural.<ref name="mel">{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Black|url=https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/why-is-everyone-suddenly-saying-yall|title=Why Is Everyone Suddenly Saying 'Y'All'?|date=November 12, 2018|work=Mel Magazine}}</ref>
* Notwithstanding its etymology, the {{m|en|all}} in {{m|en|y'all}} is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier. Thus, just as {{m|en|us}} may refer either to ''some of us'' or ''all of us'' in standard English, {{m|en|y'all}} may refer either to ''some of '''y'all''''' or to ''all [of] '''y'all'''.''
* ''Y'all'' is not considered informal speech, but is also not considered formal -- ''You all'' would, to a few, be considered more formal, but is not required in formal situations nor is it encouraged.
