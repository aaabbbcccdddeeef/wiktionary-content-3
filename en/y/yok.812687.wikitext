* {{IPA|/jok/|lang=tr}}

===Noun===
'''yok'''

====Usage notes====
In Turkish, a [[predicate]] don't have to be a verb, unlike English. By adding a [[copula]], which is a suffix in Turkish, nouns can be made predicate. '''yok''' is a noun, it can be made a predicate by adding that suffix copula (there is no suffix added to this word because third person singular indicative of Turkish "to be" is "no suffix"). For example, -ım is the first person singular of Turkish "to be" so ''varım'' is the equivaltent of "I am" (in the meaning of "I exist", as in the sentence "I think, therefore I am")
