====Personal pronoun====
'''ye'''

# {{context|Northern English dialect|Cornish dialect|Geordie|archaic|}} [[you]] (the people being addressed).
#: Note: ''Ye'' was originally used only for the nominative case (as the subject), and only for the second person plural. Later, ''ye'' was used as a subject or an object, either singular or plural, which is the way that ''you'' is used today.

===Etymology 2===
From the {{ME.}} ''[[Þe]]''. Printers who couldn't reproduce the "''Þ''" (''thorn'') character (which corresponds to the modern  (voiced) "''th''" sound, as in 'the'), substitued a "''y''".  Despite the use of 'y', it was still read as "the".
