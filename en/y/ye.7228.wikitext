{{rank|sort|town|dark|437|ye|common|subject|can't}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|ang}} {{term|ge|ġē|lang=ang}}, the nominative case of the second person plural personal pronoun. See also {{term|you}}.

====Pronunciation====
* {{a|RP}} & {{a|US}} {{IPA|/jiː/}}, {{SAMPA|/ji:/}}
* {{audio|en-us-ye.ogg|Audio (US)}}
*: {{rhymes|iː}}

====Pronoun====
{{en-pron|desc=personal pronoun}}

# {{context|Northumbrian|Cornwall|archaic|}} [[you]] (the people being addressed).

=====Usage notes=====
{{term|ye|Ye}} was originally used only for the nominative case (as the subject), and only for the second person plural. Later, {{term|ye}} was used as a subject or an object, either singular or plural, which is the way that {{term|you}} is used today.

=====Derived terms=====
* [[d'ye]]
* [[hear ye]]
* [[ye gods]]

=====References=====

===Etymology 2===
From the {{etyl|enm}} {{term|Þe|lang=enm}}. Printers who couldn't reproduce the {{term|Þ||thorn}} character (which corresponds to the modern  (voiceless) {{term|th}} sound, as in {{term|thin}}, but later used for both {{term|th}} sounds), substituted a {{term|y}}.  Despite the use of {{term|y}}, it was still read as {{term|the}}.

# A transliteration of any of a number of Chinese characters properly represented as having one of four tones, [[yē]], [[yé]], [[yě]], or [[yè]].
