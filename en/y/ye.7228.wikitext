==English==

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|ang}} {{term|ge|ġē|lang=ang}}, the nominative case of the second-person plural personal pronoun. See also {{term|you}}.

====Pronunciation====
* {{a|RP}} & {{a|US}} {{IPA|/jiː/}}, {{SAMPA|/ji:/}}
* {{audio|en-us-ye.ogg|Audio (US)}}
* {{rhymes|iː}}

====Pronoun====
{{en-pron|desc=personal pronoun}}

# {{context|Northumbria|Cornwall|Irish|archaic|}} [[you]] (the people being addressed).

=====Usage notes=====
{{term|ye|Ye}} was originally used only for the nominative case (as the subject), and only for the second-person plural. Later, {{term|ye}} was used as a subject or an object, either singular or plural, which is the way that {{term|you}} is used today.

=====Derived terms=====
* [[d'ye]]
* [[hear ye]]
* [[ye gods]]

=====References=====
* {{R:Dobson & Irwin Newcastle 1970}}

===Etymology 2===
From {{etyl|enm}} {{term|þe|lang=enm}}. The letter {{term|y}} is a variant of {{term|þ||thorn}}, a letter which corresponds to modern {{term|th}}. Etymological ''y'' was for a time distinguished by a dot, {{term|ẏ}}, but the letters conflated when that was dropped. Despite the occasional modern use of {{term|y}} in the word, it is still read as {{term|the}}.
