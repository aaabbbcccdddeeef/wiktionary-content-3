===Etymology 1===
From {{OE.}} ''[[ge#Old English|ġē]]'', the nominative case of the second person plural personal pronoun. See also ''[[you]]''.

====Pronunciation====
*''[[RP]] & US:'' {{IPA|/jiː/}}, {{SAMPA|/ji:/}}
*{{audio|en-us-ye.ogg|Audio (US)}}
*:{{rhymes|iː}}

====Pronoun====
{{en-pron}}

# {{context|personal|Northern English dialect|Cornish dialect|Geordie|archaic|}} [[you]] (the people being addressed).
#: Note: ''Ye'' was originally used only for the nominative case (as the subject), and only for the second person plural. Later, ''ye'' was used as a subject or an object, either singular or plural, which is the way that ''you'' is used today.

===Etymology 2===
From the {{ME.}} ''[[Þe]]''. Printers who couldn't reproduce the "''Þ''" (''thorn'') character (which corresponds to the modern  (voiced) "''th''" sound, as in 'the'), substituted a "''y''".  Despite the use of 'y', it was still read as "the".

# A transliteration of any of a number of Chinese characters properly represented as having one of four tones, [[yē]], [[yé]], [[yě]], or [[yè]].

English transcriptions of Chinese speech often fail to distinguish between the critical tonal differences employed in the Chinese language, using words such as this one without the appropriate indication of tone.
