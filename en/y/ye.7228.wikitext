====Pronunciation====
* ''[[RP]] & US:'' {{IPA|/jiː/}}, {{SAMPA|/ji:/}}
* {{audio|en-us-ye.ogg|Audio (US)}}

====Personal pronoun====
'''ye'''
# {{archaic}} [[you]] (the people being addressed).
#: Note: ''Ye'' was originally used only used for the nominative case (as the subject), and only for the second person plural. Later, ''ye'' was used as a subject or an object, either singular or plural, which is the way that ''you'' is used today.

===Etymology 2===
:from the Middle English ''Þe''. Printers who couldn't reproduce the "''Þ''" (''thorn'') character (which corresponds to the modern  (voiced) "''th''" sound, as in 'the'), substitued a "''y''".  Despite the use of 'y', it was still read "the".
