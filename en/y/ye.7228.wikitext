{{rank|sort|town|dark|437|ye|common|subject|can't}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{OE.}} {{term|ge|ġē|lang=ang}}, the nominative case of the second person plural personal pronoun. See also {{term|you}}.

====Pronunciation====
*{{a|RP}} & {{a|US}} {{IPA|/jiː/}}, {{SAMPA|/ji:/}}
*{{audio|en-us-ye.ogg|Audio (US)}}
*:{{rhymes|iː}}

====Pronoun====
{{en-pron|desc=personal pronoun}}

# {{context|Northern English dialect|Cornish dialect|Geordie|archaic|}} [[you]] (the people being addressed).

====Usage notes====
''Ye'' was originally used only for the nominative case (as the subject), and only for the second person plural. Later, ''ye'' was used as a subject or an object, either singular or plural, which is the way that ''you'' is used today.

===Etymology 2===
From the {{ME.}} {{term|Þe|lang=enm}}. Printers who couldn't reproduce the "''Þ''" (''thorn'') character (which corresponds to the modern  (voiced) "''th''" sound, as in 'the'), substituted a "''y''".  Despite the use of 'y', it was still read as "the".

====Article====
{{infl|en|article}}

# {{context|archaic|definite}} [[the]]
#:'''''Ye''' Olde Medicine Shoppe''.

=== Usage ===
The word ''Ye'' was not, and had never been, utilized as a definite article throughout the history of the English language. In fact, it is only through the very ignorance of certain people that 'Ye' is, at all, seen in such instances as it is seen 'Ye Olde Medicine Shoppe'. For it was during an age when thorn ([[Þ]]) was well nigh rendered obsolete, when individuals had begun to confuse the letter 'Y' with the said character. And thus, from thence, the word 'Ye' (as a definite article) came into sight.

'''ye'''

# A transliteration of any of a number of Chinese characters properly represented as having one of four tones, [[yē]], [[yé]], [[yě]], or [[yè]].
