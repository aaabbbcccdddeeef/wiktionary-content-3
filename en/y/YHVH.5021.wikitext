===Proper noun===
'''YHVH'''

#known as the "[[Tetragrammaton]]", the four Hebrew letters [[יהוה]] which are transliterated into the Latin alphabet as YHVH (or IHVH, JHVH, or YHWH). These are usually combined with vowels in English to arrive at the spelling "[[Jehovah]]," but some Bible scholars agree that a perhaps closer pronunciation to the original Hebrew word would be something like "[[Yahweh]]".
