===Etymology===
{{wikipedia|Yahweh (name)}}
The usual form of the ancient West Semitic ({{etyl|he|en}}) {{m|he|יהוה}} used in scholarship.
Used especially in discussions of the religion of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
The spelling {{m|en|Jahweh}} was used in German since the 1850s. The spelling {{m|en||Yahweh}} in English (ensuring the pronunciation of the initial consonant as {{IPAchar|/j/}}) first appears in the 1860s.

As early as 1860 in the ''Herald of the Kingdom and Age to Come'' edited by John Thomas, founder of the Antipas Christadelphians ([http://christadelphianaudio.org/books/HeraldoftheKingdom/HeraldoftheKingdom&AgetoCome1860.pdf vol. X. no. 1, Westchester, New York, January 1860]).

First appears in English Bible translations for the [[Tetragrammaton]] in 1902 Emphasized Bible (EBR).
