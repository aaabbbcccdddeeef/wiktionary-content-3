==English==

===Etymology===
{{wikipedia|Yahweh (name)}}
The usual form of the ancient West Semitic (Hebrew)  {{etyl|he|en}} {{term|יהוה|sc=Hebr|lang=he}} used in scholarship.
Used especially in discussions of the religion of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
The spelling ''[[Jahweh]]'' was used in German since the 1850s. The spelling ''Yahweh'' in English (ensuring the pronunciation of the initial consonant as /j/) first appears in the 1860s. 

As early as 1860 in the ''Herald of the Kingdom and Age to Come'' edited by John Thomas, founder of the Antipas Christadelphians ([http://christadelphianaudio.org/books/HeraldoftheKingdom/HeraldoftheKingdom&AgetoCome1860.pdf vol. X. no. 1, Westchester, New York, January 1860]).
Also used in some Bible translations for the [[Tetragrammaton]], in the Emphasized Bible (1902), and since the 1950s in Bibles published by the "Sacred Name Movement", a current in US Adventism.
