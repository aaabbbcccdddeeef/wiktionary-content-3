===Pronoun===
'''ya’ll''' {{p}}

"Ya'll" is the prevalent variant of the word "y'all" in Texas and the rural South, where the term originated.  In that region, "ya'll" is widely regarded as the proper spelling of the word.  Traditional southerners protest the conversion of the spelling to "y'all" by dictionary editors from the northeast who maintain that the logical contraction of "you" and "all" should be "y'all."  The mistake, southerners contend, is to assume that the contraction combines "you" and "all" to begin with.  Instead, the term "ya'll" evolved by combining the word "ya" (the phonetic spelling of "you" as historically pronounced in the South) and "all"--hence "ya'll."
