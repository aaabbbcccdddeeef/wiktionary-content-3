===References===
* Philippe Descola, ''In the Society of Nature: A Native Ecology in Amazonia'' (1996, ISBN 0521574676), page 36: "Like other Amazonian groups, the Achuar make a clear lexical distinction between celestial water, ''yumi'', and terrestrial water, ''entza'' (Levi-Strauss 1964: 195). ''Yumi'' designates the rainwater {{...}}. ''Entza'' is both water from the river and the river itself; it is the clear water of fast-flowing streams, the brown boiling flood waters, the slack, low waters of the river, and the stagnant waters of the swamps. By some curious paradox, the Achuar use ''yumi'' to designate the cooking water used in making manoic beer and for boiling the tubers; and yet they fetch this celestial water from the river in a gourd they also call ''yumi''."
