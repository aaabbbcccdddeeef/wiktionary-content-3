====Usage notes====
* Originally, {{m|en||you}} was specifically plural (indicating multiple people), and specifically the object form (serving as the object of a verb or preposition; like {{m|en|us}} as opposed to {{m|en|we}}). The subject pronoun was {{m|en|ye}}, and the corresponding singular pronouns were {{m|en|thee}} and {{m|en|thou}}, respectively. In some forms of (older) English, {{m|en||you}} and {{m|en||ye}} doubled as polite singular forms, e.g. used in addressing superiors, with {{m|en||thee}} and {{m|en||thou}} being the non-polite singular forms. In the 1600s, some writers objected to the use of "singular you"<ref>''The British Friend'' (November 1st, 1861), notes: "In 1659, Thomas Ellwood, Milton's friend and scoretary, thus expresses himself‚Äî‚Äú The corrupt and unsound form of speaking in the plural number to a single person, you to one instead of thou, contrary to the pure, plain, and simple language ..."</ref> (compare objections to {{m|en|they|the "singular they"}}), but in modern English {{m|en||thee}} and {{m|en||thou}} are archaic and all but nonexistent and {{m|en||you}} is used for both the singular and the plural.
* Several forms of English now distinguish singular ''you'' from various [[marked]] plural forms, such as {{m|en|you guys}}, {{m|en|y'all}}, or {{m|en|youse}}, though not all of these are completely equivalent or considered [[Standard English]].
* The pronoun {{m|en||you}} is usually, but not always, omitted in imperative sentences. In affirmatives, it may be included before the verb (''You go right ahead''; ''You stay out of it''); in negative imperatives, it may be included either before the ''don't'', or (more commonly) after it (''Don't you dare go in there''; ''Don't you start now'').
