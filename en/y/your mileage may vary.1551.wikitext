==English==

===Etymology===
In the United States, the [http://www.epa.gov Environmental Protection Agency] requires a set of standard emissions tests on all new vehicles which simulate city and highway driving.  Part of the test measures estimated city and highway gas mileage estimates.  Since no test can exactly simulate all driving habits and conditions, actual gas mileage of each vehicle will vary.  As a result, when these estimated mileage claims from automobile manufacturers appear in advertisements, they are almost always accompanied with the standard disclaimer "your mileage may vary."

===Phrase===
