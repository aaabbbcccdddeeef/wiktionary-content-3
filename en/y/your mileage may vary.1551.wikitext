==English==

===Etymology===
In the United States, the [http://www.epa.gov Environmental Protection Agency] requires a set of standard emissions tests on all new vehicles which simulate city and highway driving.  Part of the test measures estimated city and highway gas mileage estimates.  Since no test can exactly simulate all driving habits and conditions, actual gas mileage of each vehicle will vary.  As a result, these estimates mileage claims from automobile manufacturers almost always appear with the disclaimer "your mileage may vary."

When used in discussions and forums on the internet, this expression will frequently abbreviated as ''YMMV''. 

===Idiom===
'''[[your]] [[mileage]] [[may]] [[vary]]'''
# {{idiom}}: It may work differently in your situation.
# {{idiom}}: To express a possible difference in taste, "this is just my opinion, your opinion may be different". 
#:''It's a very popular name. For that reason alone I wouldn't choose it.  It's 'trendy'.  '''Your mileage may vary,''' of course.''
