==English==

===Etymology===
In the United States, the [http://www.epa.gov Environmental Protection Agency] requires a set of standard emissions tests on all new vehicles which simulate city and highway driving.  Part of the test measures estimated city and highway gas mileage estimates.  Since no test can exactly simulate all driving habits and conditions, actual gas mileage of each vehicle will vary.  As a result, when these estimated mileage claims from automobile manufacturers appear in advertisements, they almost always accompanied with the standard disclaimer "your mileage may vary."

When used in discussions and forums on the internet, this expression will frequently abbreviated as ''YMMV''.

===Idiom===
'''[[your]] [[mileage]] [[may]] [[vary]]'''
# {{idiom}}: It may work differently in your situation.
# {{idiom}}: To express a possible difference in taste, "this is just my opinion, your opinion may be different". 
# {{idiom}}: To express an possible difference in experience, "this has been my experience, your experience may be different". 
#:''It's a very popular name. For that reason alone I wouldn't choose it.  It's 'trendy'.  '''Your mileage may vary,''' of course.''
