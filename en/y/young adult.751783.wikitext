===Usage notes===
* This is a nebulous concept and no fixed ages can be sensibly assigned to the term. However:
** in psychology and medicine,  age-ranges such as 18 to 40 or 15 to 30 <ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pedi.12198/abstract</ref> are sometimes quoted.
** in publishing, young-adult fiction is aimed at adolescents with an age-range of 12 to 18.
