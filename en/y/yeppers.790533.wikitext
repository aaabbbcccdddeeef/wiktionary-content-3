Historical Annotation:
Although the origins of this word have been widely debated amongst grammarians and liguistic scholars alike, its original use can be traced back to Brian S. of San Diego, California. Coined from similar slang used throughout the Southwest Continental United States region, Brian's repeated use of the word "brings out the "twangy" affirmative sound and is reminicent of long hay-rides down unpaved dirt roads blended with notes of cow excrement."
