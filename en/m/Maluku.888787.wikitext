===Etymology===
The islands are said to have been named {{der|en|ar|جَزِيرَات المَلِك|lit=king islands}} by Arab merchants. However, since the name itself has been mentioned in a 14th-century [[w:Majapahit|Majapahit]] eulogy, [[w:Nagarakretagama|Nagarakretagama]], that predates the arrival of Islam in Maluku at the late fifteenth century, other sources claim that the name comes from a local language with the meaning "the head of a bull" or "the head of something large".
