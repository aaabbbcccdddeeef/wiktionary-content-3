{{wikipedia}}
Anglicised pronunciation of a word in many southern and western Asian languages. The ''-d'' probably from assimilation with Etymology 1 above, or from comparison with [[pound]].
: Original root is unclear, but may be {{etyl|ar}} {{term|من|مَنّ|tr=mann|sc=Arab|lang=ar}}, {{etyl|fa}} {{term|من|tr=man|sc=fa-Arab|lang=fa}} or {{etyl|sa}} {{term|मानः|tr=man|sc=Deva|lang=sa}}. {{etyl|sa}} has a verb root {{term|मा|tr=ma-|sc=Deva|lang=sa}}, "to [[measure]]".

====Alternative spellings====
* [[mun]]
* [[man]]

====Noun====
{{en-noun}}

# {{archaic}} A unit of weight in southern and western Asia, whose value varied widely by location.  Two maunds made one chest of opium in East India.  One maund equalled 136 [[pound]]s of opium in Turkey.
#* '''1888''', Rudyard Kipling, ‘In Flood Time’, ''In Black and White'', Folio Society 2005, p. 410:
#*: Now the rail has come, and the fire-carriage says ''buz-buz-buz'', and a hundred lakhs of '''''maunds''''' slide across that big bridge.

====Usage notes====
This spelling ('''maund''') is usually used for the unit in [[British India]], equal to 25&nbsp;pounds [[avoirdupois]] at [[Madras]], 28&nbsp;pounds avoirdupois at [[Bombay]] and 10&nbsp;[[troy pound]]s at [[Calcutta]]. For the equivalent unit in the [[W:Mughal Empire|Mughal Empire]] and in [[Persian]]- and [[Arabic]]-speaking countries, it is more usual to use the spelling ''[[mun]]'' or ''[[man]]'' (italicised to show that the word has not been assimilated into English).
