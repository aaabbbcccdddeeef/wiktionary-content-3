# [[sailor]]; also "mate;" boon companion
#* '''1949,''' Francis van Wyck Mason, ''Cutlass Empire'',
#*:[&hellip;]  "Among the Brethren of the Coast--we tykes no wimmen save in passing, as it were, they being bothersome, frail and scatterbrained creatures. Instead we tykes a blood-brother, or matelot. . . A matelot, 'e fights along side o' yer, nurses yer if yer falls sick. Â Wots 'is is yours and whats yours is 'is. . . Take Klaas yonder, and young Pedro [described earlier as a slender hipped boy with deep femine brown eyes]; they shared the same barbacoa six, seven year and ye'll never come on 'em more than a few yards apart."  To this explanation [Harry] Morgan listened in growing amazement and began to comprehend why none of these bestial-appearing boucan makers had so much as addressed Kate.[&hellip;]
#* '''1984,''' John Harris, ''A Funny Place to Hold a War'',
#*:[&hellip;] a chief petty officer, snarled something under his breath about bloody 'am-fisted matelots [&hellip;]
#* '''1997,''' Tristan Jones, ''Heart of Oak'', [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1574090194&id=v_KgYDwH9lsC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=matelot+ship&sig=QDHI9me2dRfGRDYt2XzON6viuZQ page 103],
#*:So far as the average '''matelot''' was concerned, there was little romanticism about the prefence for frigates, destroyers, frail E-boats that could be blown up with one well-aimed cannon, and submarines, those breeding grounds of TB and madness.
#* '''2004,''' Alan O'Reilly, ''Sound of Battle'', ISBN 1595262881, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1595262881&id=Ay-iHQZ2WhYC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&ots=R6gmjSkYEd&dq=%22the+leg+had+turned+septic+but+the+matelot+was+endearingly+cheerful%22&sig=3XHH4iipBoTF6vJJPDgM-3u293U page 147],
#*:One day, a stalwart sailor was brought in with a severe fracture below the knee [&hellip;]
#*:A week later the leg had turned septic but the '''matelot''' was endearing cheerful.
#*:"Never mind, Sister" he assured Anne. "I'll get a piece of whalebone, like Captain Ahab."
#* '''2005''' William Atlay, ''All for a King's Shilling'', Melrose Press, ISBN 190522625X, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN190522625X&id=1CzRwj5CHLQC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=matelot&num=100&sig=6OZxOLjHkI3yBWPKTDz6vr4WISk page 72],
#*: Our '''matelot''' took us out to sea in what I believed was not a very seaworthy boat.
