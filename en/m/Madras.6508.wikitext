===Etymology===
The etymology is uncertain; older forms are ''Madraspatan'', ''Madraspatanam'', and ''Madraspattinam'', the final element being from Sanskrit [[पत्तन]] (pattana) 'village, city'.  It is possible that ''Madras'' is from Arabic [[مدرسة]] (madrásah) 'college', from [[درس]] (dárasa) 'to learn, to study'.
