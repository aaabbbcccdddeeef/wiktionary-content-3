=====Usage notes=====
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun ''[[thou]]'' was in active use, and verbs used ''[[-est]]'' for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb ''make'' had the form ''[[makest]]'', and had ''[[madest]]'' for its past tense.
* Similarly, when the ending ''[[-eth]]'' was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form ''[[maketh]]'' was used.
