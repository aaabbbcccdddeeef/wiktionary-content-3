===Etymology===
From {{bor|es|nci|Mēxihco}}, originally a [[toponym]] for the [[w:Valley of Mexico|Valley of Mexico]]. Aside from the element {{m|nci|-co}}, the Nahuatl locative suffix, the etymology of this place-name remains uncertain. It has been suggested to be derived from {{m|nci|Mexihtli|Mēxihtli}}, a name belonging to the Aztecs' patron god [[Huitzilopochtli]], in which case the associated locative name could be interpreted as ("place of Huitzilopochtli" or “place where Huitzilopochtli lives”). Another hypothesis suggests the name to be a portmanteau of the words {{m|nci|mētztli||moon}} + {{m|nci|xīctli||navel}}, hence the hypothetical original form ''*Mētzxīcco'', meaning “place at the navel/center of the moon”, perhaps referring to the city of [[Tenochtitlan]]'s position in [[w:Lake Texcoco|Lake Texcoco]], which was the central lake of a system of interconnected lakes whose shape was likened to that of a rabbit by the Aztecs; an animal associated to the moon. (If that is the case, then the sound of ''tz'' {{IPAchar|/t͡s/}} in ''mētz-'' has been absorbed into the initial ''x'' {{IPAchar|/ʃ/}} of ''-xīc-'', while the geminate ''cc'' {{IPAchar|/kː/}} in ''-xīcco'' has been transformed into the consonant cluster ''hc'' {{IPAchar|/ʔk/}}.) A third hypothesis suggests a derivation incorporating {{m|nci|metl||maguey}} (stem ''me-''), perhaps from {{m|nci|Mēctli}}, a [[maguey]] goddess, {{der|es|azc-pro|}}.
