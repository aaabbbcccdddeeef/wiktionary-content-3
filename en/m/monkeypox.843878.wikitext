|text='''Monkeypox''' is a rare viral pox-like disease from the smallpox family, only milder. It can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, contact with body fluids or contact with an infected animal or animal products.<br>The first human case of '''monkeypox''' was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The United States saw a large outbreak among humans in 2003 after the virus spread from imported African rodents to pet prairie dogs. However, this is believed to be the first '''monkeypox''' virus infection in a Texas resident, according to Dallas County health officials.}}
