===Noun===
'''mute point'''

# an irrelevant or misleadig argument/view point - IE the point is mute.

While there is evidence of the word moot being correct, there is evidence it has surfaced from mid western US accents and the way it was Pronounced(as the word moot orginates from law terminology - this is even more likely given the context it was used in).
