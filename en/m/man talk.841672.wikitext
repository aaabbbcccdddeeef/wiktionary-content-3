===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[man]] [[talk]]|-}}

# A discussion between male colleagues seen as inappropriate for female ears. Often involves dirty jokes and discussions about sports.

===Usage notes===
The term is considered sexist today. An infamous use seen as more offensive today is Sean Connery (James Bond) in ''Goldfinger'', when he asks his female companion to give him and Felix Leiter a moment and, when asked what for, replies, "Man talk" and slaps her on the bum.
