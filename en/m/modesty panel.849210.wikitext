A '''modesty panel''' is a thin screen of wood or metal that is attached to the front of a [[desk]], [[electronic organ]], or similar items. The panel provides privacy for the person seated at the desk or organ, as it covers the upper part of the legs. This privacy role is  particularly useful in cases where the desk or organ is positioned in front of a class or hall. The modesty panel provides structural support for the four legs of the desk or organ, and it may also be used as a place for affixing electric cabling, computer cabling, or electrical extension boxes.
