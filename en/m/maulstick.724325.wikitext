A maulstick is a short pole that a painter uses to steady his or her hand for rendering fine detail. The artist holds the pole diagonally across the paint surface with one hand while resting the painting or drawing hand on the length of the pole. The pole has a pad on one end to prevent damage to the surface on which it rests.
