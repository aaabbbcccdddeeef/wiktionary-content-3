===Noun===

# Mathetics is the [[science]] of [[learning]]. The term was coined by [[John Amos Comenius]] (1592-1670) in his work Spicilegium didacticum, published in 1680. He understood '''Mathetics''' as the opposite of [[didactics]], the science of [[teaching]]. '''Mathetics''' considers and uses findings of current interest from pedagogical psychology, [[neurophysiology]] and [[information technology]].

[[Seymour Papert]], MIT mathematician, educator, and author, explains the rationale behind the term '''mathetics''' in Chapter 5 (A Word for Learning) of his book, ''The Children's Machine''. The origin of the word, according to Papert, is not from "mathematics," but from the Greek, ''mathÄ“matikos'', which means ''disposed to learn''. This word (or one like it) should become as much part of the vocabulary about education as is the word [[pedagogy]] or [[instructional design]].
