The {{glossary|noun}} is borrowed from {{bor|en|fr|monolithe|t=object made from a single block of stone}}, from {{der|en|frm|monolythe|t=made from a single block of stone}} {{qualifier|rare}}, and from their {{glossary|etymon}} {{bor|en|la|monolithus|t=made from a single block of stone}}, from {{der|en|grc|μονόλιθος|t=made from a single block of stone}}, from {{m|grc|μονο-|pos=prefix meaning ‘alone; single’}} (from {{m|grc|μόνος|t=alone; only, unique}}, ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*mey-|t=little, small}}) + {{m|grc|λίθος|t=a stone; stone as a substance}}; analysable as {{confix|en|mono|lith}}. The English word is cognate with {{cog|de|monolith|t=made from a single block of stone}}.<ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=adj.'' and ''n|id=121455|date=December 2002|nodot=1}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=n}}</ref>

The {{glossary|verb}} is derived from the noun.
