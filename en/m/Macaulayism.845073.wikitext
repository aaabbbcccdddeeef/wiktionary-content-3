The term is derived from the name of [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] also known as First baron of Macaulay. Thomas Macualay was instrumental is intourducing English as a medium of instruction for higher Education in India.

The term Macaulay's Children is used to refer to people born of Indian ancestry who adopt Western culture as a lifestyle, or display attitudes influenced by colonisers. The term is usually used in a derogatory fashion, and the connotation is one of disloyalty to one's country and one's heritage.

The Hindu Right in India often blames Macaulay and his education system for producing a generation of Indians not proud of their heritage.
