#*: The Indo-Aryan languages or '''macrolanguages''' of the plains merge into each other, being on the local level made up of enormous dialect continua (e.g. PANJABI-HINDI-BIHARI-RAJASTHANI-PAHARI). ¶ These fluid ‘'''macrolanguages'''’ (indicated by capital letters, e.g. HINDI) may have “dialects” which are mutually unintelligible and hard to classify.

#*: A linguist working with the criterion of mutual intelligibility would recognize six languages in central and western Victoria, most of them covering large areas. These widespread languages would not have been recognized as languages by the speakers themselves and they have no native name. The largest '''macrolanguage''' covers most of western Victoria north of Ballarat and Hamilton.
# {{lb|en|ISO}} A book-keeping device where, when a language as defined under the ISO 639-2 standard developed by the US Library of Congress, for the purpose of encoding the languages its books are written in, does not correspond to a single language under the ISO 639-3 standard developed by the Summer Institute of Linguistics, for the purpose of listing languages in their publication ''Ethnologue'', the ISO 639-2 language is assigned an ISO 639-3 code as a "macrolanguage".

#*: Some existing code elements in ISO 639-2, and the corresponding code elements in ISO 639-1, are designated in those parts of ISO 639 as individual language code elements, yet are in a one-to-many relationship with individual language code elements in [ISO 639-3]. For purposes of [ISO 639-3], they are considered to be '''macrolanguage''' code elements.

====Usage notes====
Since its adoption by the ISO, the word "macrolanguage" may be avoided in linguistics, as it has no linguistic meaning in ISO usage. Its primary usage has become to coordinate between ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 when those standards have different definitions of a language: The ISO 639-2 definition of a language is based on a shared writing system and literature, while the ISO 639-3 definition is based on mutual intelligibility (with some exceptions such as [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Hindustani]] and [[Malay]], which are single languages linguistically but which for political reasons have been assigned multiple ISO 639-3 codes). This results in e.g. [[Chinese]], [[Arabic]], [[Quechua]] and [[Zapotec]] being coded as single languages under ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 but as multiple languages under ISO 639-3, so they are each assigned a macrolanguage code under ISO 639-3.
