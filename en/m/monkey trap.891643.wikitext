{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|literally}} A cage containing a banana with a hole large enough for a monkey's hand to fit in, but not large enough for a monkey's fist (clutching a banana) to come out; [[anecdotal]]ly used to catch monkeys that lack the intellect to let go of the banana and run away.
# {{lb|en|figuratively}} A clever trap of any sort, that owes its success to the ineptitude or gullibility of the victim.
