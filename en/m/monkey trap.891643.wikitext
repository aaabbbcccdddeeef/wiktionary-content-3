===Noun===
{{en-noun|head=[[monkey]] [[trap]]}}

# {{context|literally|probably folk-lore|lang=en}} A cage containing a banana with a hole large enough for a monkey's hand to fit in, but not large enough for a monkey's fist (clutching a banana) to come out. Used to "catch" monkeys that lack the intellect to let go of the banana and run away.
# {{context|figuratively|lang=en}} A clever trap of any sort, that owes its success to the ineptitude or gullibility of the victim.
