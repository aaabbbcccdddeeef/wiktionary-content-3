===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[monkey]] [[trap]]}}

# {{literally|probably folk-lore*}} A cage containing a banana with a hole large enough for a monkey's hand to fit in, but not large enough for a monkey's fist (clutching a banana) to come out.  Used to "catch" monkeys that lack the intellect/will to let go of the banana and run away. 
# {{figuratively}} A clever trap of any sort, that owes its success to the fixation, ineptitude, or gullibility of the victim.
