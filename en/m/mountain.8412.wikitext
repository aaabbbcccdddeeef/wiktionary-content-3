===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*men-|id=stand out}}
From {{inh|en|enm|mountayne}}, {{m|enm|mountain}}, {{m|enm|montaigne}}, from {{der|en|xno|montaigne|muntaine}}, {{m|fro|montaigne|muntaigne}}, from {{der|en|VL.|*montānea}}, a collective based on {{der|en|la|mōns|montem|t=mountain}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*monti}} (compare {{cog|cy|mynydd||mountain}}, {{cog|sq|mat||bank, shore}}, {{cog|ae|𐬨𐬀𐬙𐬌|t=promontory}}), from {{m|ine-pro|*men-||to project, stick out}}. Displaced native {{ncog|ang|beorg}} and {{m|ang|dūn}}, and partially displaced non-native Old English {{m|ang|munt}}, from Latin {{m|la|mōns}} (whence English {{m|en|mount}}).

====Usage notes====
As with the names of {{l|en|river|rivers}} and {{l|en|lake|lakes}}, the names of mountains are typically formed by adding the generic word before or after the unique term. In the case of mountains, when the word precedes the unique term, {{m|en|mount}} is used: {{m|en|Mount Olympus}}, {{m|en|Mount Everest}}, {{m|en|Mount Tai}}; when the word follows the unique term, ''mountain'' is used: {{m|en|Crowfoot Mountain}}, {{m|en|Blue Mountain}}, {{m|en|Rugged Mountain}}. Generally speaking, such names will be adjectives or attributive nouns, but many foreign placenames formed with adjectives—as China's {{m|en|Huashan}}—are translated as though they were proper names: {{m|en|Mount Hua}} instead of ''Hua Mountain'' or ''Flourishing Mountain''.

[[mountain chain|Mountain chains]] are never named with {{m|en|mount}}, only with {{m|en|mountains}}, a translated term, or a pluralized name.
