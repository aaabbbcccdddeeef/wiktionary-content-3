# A [[noun]] that normally cannot be [[count]]ed.

====Usage notes====

* Some mass nouns, such as ''[[whisky]]'', can also be count nouns when they refer to a variety (“Scotch and Canadian whiskies”) or in informal usage to denote a serving (“please bring us two whiskies”).

====Synonyms====
* [[non-count noun]]
* [[uncountable noun]]
