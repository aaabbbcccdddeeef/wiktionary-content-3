====Quotations====
* '''1989''' David Leavitt: ''Equal Affections''. ISBN 0-670-821977 page 215:
*: Herbert, Sydney, '''Milton''', Seymour. You know, all the time I was growing up I thought those were the most ordinary Jewish first names, until someone pointed out that they were British last names. I guess to my great-grandparents those names must have sounded so modern, so sophisticated, so - non-Eastern European. And now they're just Uncle Miltie, Uncle Sy, Uncle Herb. Do other people have Uncle Donne and Uncle Wordsworth?
