There never existed in the countries mentioned, least of all in Spain, any National Catholic Church.  There would not have existed any such contradictorially-named organization even in England had it not been for the lechery of Henry VIII.  Other similar '''misstatements''' might be noticed here and there.  The author's intention, however, is patent and his success in this respect is noteworthy.}}
