===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[Mexican]] [[wave]]}}

# {{British|Ireland|Australia}} A [[phenomenon]] that primarily occurs at sports events, where the members of the crowd stand up and/or raise their hands [[in turn]], creating the [[illusion]] of a wave passing through the crowd.
#*'''1995,''' Shane Cloude, ''An Introduction to Electromagnetic Wave Propagation &amp; Antennas'', Springer, 0-387-91501-X, pages 3–4,
#*:This is an important idea and can best be illustrated by analogy with a '''Mexican wave'''. Although the '''Mexican wave''' seems to involve the coherent motion of a large number of people, it is clear to those who have been involved, <!-- [sic] comma --> that the “trigger” for an individual to react is entirely spatially and temporally local, i.e. the individual reacts at the appropriate time and space point simply by waiting until his or her neighbours react.

#*:The usual signals for standing are: at the arrival of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; […]; and every time the Colour passes in front of you. The effect can sometimes be like a rather well-dressed '''Mexican wave'''.
#*'''2007,''' Scott Hamilton, ''An Analog Electronics Companion: Basic Circuit Design for Engineers and Scientists'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-68780-5, page 94,
#*:A '''Mexican wave''' travels around a stadium very much more <!-- [sic] --> rapidly than a person could.
