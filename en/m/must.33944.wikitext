==English==

{{rank|did|such|great|86|must|these|two|us}}

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|ang}} {{term|mosten}}, past tense of {{term|motan||be able to}}.  Cognate with Dutch {{term|moesten}} and {{term|moeten}} and with German {{term|müssen}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{qualifier|stressed}} {{IPA|/mʌst/}}, {{SAMPA|/mVst/}}
* {{qualifier|unstressed}} {{IPA|/məs(t)/}}, {{SAMPA|/m@s(t)/}}
* {{audio|en-us-must.ogg|Audio (US)}}
* {{rhymes|ʌst}}

===Verb===
{{en-verb|inf=-|[[must]]|-|had to|-}}

# {{context|modal|_|auxiliary|defective}} To do with [[certainty]]; {{non-gloss definition|indicates that the speaker is [[certain]] that the subject will have executed the [[predicate]]}}
#: ''If it rained all day, it '''must''' be very wet outside.''
#: ''You picked one of two, and it wasn't the first: it '''must''' have been the second.''
# {{context|modal|_|auxiliary|defective}} To do as a [[require]]ment; {{non-gloss definition|indicates that the sentence subject is [[required]] as an imperative or directive to execute the sentence [[predicate]], with failure to do so resulting in a negative consequence}}.
#: ''You '''must''' arrive in class on time.'' — the requirement is an imperative
#: ''This door handle '''must''' be rotated fully.'' — the requirement is a directive

====Usage notes====
* {{sense|auxiliary|to do with certainty}} Compare with weaker auxiliary verb {{term|should}}, indicating a strong probability of the predicate's execution.
* {{sense|auxiliary|to do as a requirement}} Compare with weaker auxiliary verb {{term|should}}, indicating mere intent for the predicate's execution; and stronger auxiliary verb {{term|will}}, indicating that the negative consequence will be unusually severe.
* {{term|must|Must}} is not used to indicate obligation '''in the past'''. As indicated above, the usual form is {{term|had to}}. It is possible to use {{term|be bound to}} for the past also.  For this reason, {{term|have to}} and {{term|be bound to}} are also used as alternatives to {{term|must}} in the present and future.
