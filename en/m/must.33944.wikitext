* '''Must''' cannot be used to indicate neither logical certainty, nor obligation '''in the past'''. As indicated above, the usual form is [[had to]]. It is possible to use [[be bound to]] for the past also.
* For this reason, [[have to]] and [[be bound to]] are also used as alternatives to '''must''' in the present and future.
