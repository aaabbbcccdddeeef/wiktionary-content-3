<!-- maybe somebody can find a way to include women without twice using "he or she"? -->
#Hence, one who sacrifices his life, his station, or what is of great value to him, for the sake of principle, or to sustain a cause.  
# (with a prepositional phrase of cause) One who suffers greatly. #:''Stephen was a martyr to arthritis.
#(Usage in the early 21st century by [[fundamentalist]] [[Islamists]], usually in translation from [[Arabic]], but sometimes in English) One who, by carrying a [[bomb]] or other means, kills both himself and others. The validity of this usage is disputed by both [[Islamic]] and non-Islamic authorities, for whom both [[suicide]], and [[murder]] of [[innocents]], are [[sins]].
