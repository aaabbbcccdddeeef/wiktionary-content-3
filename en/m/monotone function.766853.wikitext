# {{lb|en|calculus}} A [[function]] ''f'' : ''X''→'''R''' (where ''X'' is a [[subset]] of '''R''', possibly a [[discrete set]]) that either never decreases or never increases as its [[independent variable]] increases; that is, either ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''f''(''y'') or ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''f''(''y'') ≤ ''f''(''x'').
#: {{ux|en|Where defined, the first derivative of a '''monotone function''' never changes sign, although it may be zero.}}

#*: '''Monotone functions''' on <math>[a, b]</math> have nice properties. For example, they are integrable on <math>[a, b]</math> and have only a countable number of jump discontinuities. In this section, we shall also show that every '''monotone function''' is a function of bounded variation, and hence the class <math>\mathit{BV}([a,b])</math> contains the class of '''monotone functions''' on <math>[a, b]</math>.

#*: We saw in the previous section that '''monotone functions''' have some nice properties. For example, a '''monotone function''' is continuous except possibly on a countable set. They are also closed under scalar multiplication, and the sum of two increasing functions is increasing. (Exercise (4) on page 103). However, the difference and product of two '''monotone functions''' are not necessarily monotone (Exercise (5) on page 103).
# {{lb|en|order theory|analysis}} A function ''f'', whose [[domain]] has a [[partial order]] "≤", with either: (1) the property that ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''f''(''y''), or (2) the property that ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''f''(''y'') ≤ ''f''(''x'').
# {{lb|en|Boolean algebra}} A [[Boolean function]] with the property that switching any one input variable from 0 to 1 results either in no change in output or a change from 0 to 1.

====Usage notes====
* The order theory definition avoids reference to the concepts {{m|en|increasing}} and {{m|en|decreasing}}, making it somewhat more generally applicable.
* In the Boolean algebra case, there is implicit in the definition an intuitively natural [[partial order]] "≤" (see ''{{w|product order}}'' on Wikipedia) such that, given two input tuples ''a'' = (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>,... ''a''<sub>n</sub>) and ''b'' = (''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>,... ''b''<sub>n</sub>), ''a'' ≤ ''b'' means that ''b'' can be obtained from ''a'' via a series of (zero or more) steps each switching an input from 0 to 1. With this partial order in mind, (only) property (1) of the order theory definition applies.
