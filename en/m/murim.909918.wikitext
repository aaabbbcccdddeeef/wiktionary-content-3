[[Murim]] is a mystery to most people, and it's intended to be that way! Murim is a coinciding world within the world. (Although not literally a planet) For example the wizard world in Harry Potter, and the Murim world in The Breaker manhwa. Murim is a name to describe "organisations" that only a select thew people in the entire world are eligible to know about. You must be qualified, like being a wizard or luckily being born into a family that is already apart of Murim etc etc. Usually these "Murim worlds" are so different to the world you and I know of, that if it became publicly known that it exists, it could change the face of the earth; causing panic and [[power struggle]]. Thus it stays a secret for the benefit of everyone.
