A '''momentary god''' is a [[god]] who exists for a specific purpose and at a specific time at a special place. It has no existence except for such purpose, time, and place. In [[Arcadia]] and [[Elis]], such a god was ''[[Myiagros]]'', who chased away the [[fly|flies]] during the [[sacrifice]]s to [[Zeus]] and [[Athena]].
