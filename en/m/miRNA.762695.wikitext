{{swp|microRNA}}

===Etymology===
From {{m|en|microRNA}}. The seminal article on microRNAs did not introduce the abbreviation ''miRNA'' nor the term ''microRNA'', but rather referred to the entities as ''small RNAs''.<ref>Lee, Roslind C., Feinbaum, Rhonda L. and Ambros, Victor. 1993. "[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8252621 The C. elegans Heterochronic Gene lin-4 Encodes Small RNAs with Antisense Complementarity to lin-14]", ''Cell'', '''75''': 843&ndash;854.</ref>
