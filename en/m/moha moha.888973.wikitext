===Etymology===
Miss Lovell's first report (quote below) spelt the creature ''moka moka'', but in her second it was ''moha moha'' (also below).

===Noun===
{{en-noun|head=[[moha]] [[moha]]}}

# {{context|cryptozoology|lang=en}} A type of sea creature reported seen by a Miss Lovell and others at [[w:Sandy Cape|Sandy Cape]] in South-East Queensland, Australia on 8 Jun 1890. She described it as some 30 feet long with a turtle-like neck extending from a rounded body some 8 feet across, and a long fish-like tail. Never seen again, and improbabilities in the description suggest a hoax.
#: 1891: ''Native blacks call it 'Moka, moka' and say they like to eat it, and that it has legs and fingers.'' &mdash; S. Lovell, ''Tempus omnia monstra'', in ''Land and Water'', London, 3 March 1891 (quoted by Malcolm Smith, ''Bunyips and Bigfoots'', Millenium Books, 1996, ISBN 1-86429-081-1, who was unable to obtain the original and so quotes from Bernard Heuvelmans, ''In the Wake of the Sea-Serpents'', 1968, who in turn apparently quotes from Antoon C. Oudemans, ''The Great Sea-Serpent'', 1892).
#: 1891: ''The blacks, who had not seen it the day I did, named it at once from my sketch, which must, therefore, be pretty accurate, and called it 'Moha, Moha', and laughed and said, 'Saucy Fellow, Meebee' &ndash; in English, 'dangerous turtle'.'' &mdash; S. Lovell, ''Land and Water'', 25 April 1891 (again Malcolm Smith from Heuvelmans etc).
