#*: A wide half-circle of foam and glinting lights and shining shoulders of green water, the great [[weir]] closed the [[backwater]] from bank to bank, troubled all the quiet surface with twirling eddies and floating foam-streaks, and deadened all other sounds with its solemn and soothing rumble. In '''midmost''' of the stream, embraced in the weir's shimmering arm-spread, a small island lay anchored, fringed close with willow and silver birch and [[alder]].
