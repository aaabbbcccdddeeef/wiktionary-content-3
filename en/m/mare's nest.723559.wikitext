==English==

===Etymology===
The phrase is derived from the [[w:Gaelic|Gaelic]] word ''mearachd'', an error, a mistake; ''mearachdaich'', mistake, err, miss; and the Gaelic word ''Nothaist'' (t silentâ€”''no-haist''), a foolish person, an idiot. As a result, the Gaelic phrase ''mearachd-nothaist'' corrupted in English into mare's nest - the error of a fool.
