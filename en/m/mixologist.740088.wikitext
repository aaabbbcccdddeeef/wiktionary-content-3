===Noun===
{{en-noun}}
# A person who creates [[cocktails]]; a [[bartender]].
#*'''1999''', Bob Emmons, ''The Book of Gins and Vodkas: A Complete Guide'', p. 63.
#*:By the way, the difference between a bartender and a '''mixologist''' can be confusing, but normally a bartender serves the patrons at a sit-down style bar, where a '''mixologist''' would usually work at a very busy service-style bar.
