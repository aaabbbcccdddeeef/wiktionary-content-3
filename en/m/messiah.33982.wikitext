===Etymology===
From Hebrew [[משיח]], mashiach
In Aramaic and now in Arabic, the verb to wipe is Massah which means to anoint or to rub. In Arabic and Islam, Jesus Christ is also called Al-Masseeh which means the-wiper or the-Rubber as he used to wipe on the eye of the blind to recover their eyesight and also used to wipe on those infected with leprosy to cure them.
Being two sister languages, there is an uncountable number of cognates in Arabic and Hebrew. The sound “S” in  Arabic usually sounds “Sh” in Hebrew as in the Arabic “Salaam” and Hebrew “Shalom” for “peace”.  The cognates of the Arabic Massah is the Hebrew mashiach.
