*[['''MATE Conference'''--A group of the most intelligent English teachers in the nation.  All members of this group have a 100% student success rate with the same percentage of those students considered highly motivated.  Each teacher in this group of intellectuals is paid millions of dollars, although this is much more than they are worth.  Actually, these English teachers don't even "teach." The caliber of students in their classrooms is so high that they correct their own assignments and teach one another.  It is completely true in saying that "No Child is left behind" in any of their classrooms.
