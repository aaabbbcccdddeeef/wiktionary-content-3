# {{lb|en|South Africa}} An order (restitutory interdict) handed down by a court on application, originating in Roman Dutch law where a person ([[spoliator]]) is compelled to return a thing that has been taken unlawfully. The case turns on [[possession]], not [[ownership]]: a ''mandement van spolie'' can even be brought by a thief where the owner unlawfully retrieves the thing stolen.
