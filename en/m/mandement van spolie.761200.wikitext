{{en-noun}}

# An order (restitutory interdict) handed down by a Court on application, originating in Roman Dutch Law where a person (spoliator) is compelled to return a thing that has been taken unlawfully. The case turns on posession, not ownership. In South African Law, a ''mandement van spolie'' can even be brought by a thief where the owner unlawfully retrieves the thing stolen. The determination of ownership takes place once the thing spoliated, is returned. The purpose is to prevent persons from taking the law into their own hands.
