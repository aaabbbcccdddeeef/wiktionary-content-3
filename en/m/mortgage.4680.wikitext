===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# A special form of [[secured loan]] where the purpose of the loan must be specified to the [[lender]], to purchase assets that must be fixed (not movable) property such as a house or piece of farm land. The assets are registered as the legal property of the [[borrower]] but the lender can seize them and dispose of them if they are not satisfied with the manner in which the repayment of the loan is conducted by the borrower.  Once the loan is fully repaid, the lender loses this right of seizure and the assets are then deemed to be [[unencumbered]].
