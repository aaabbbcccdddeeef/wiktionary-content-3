=====Usage notes=====
* The use of “man” (compare [[Old English]]: {{l|ang|mann}}, {{l|ang|wer}}, {{l|ang|wīf}}) to mean both “human (of any gender)” and “adult male”, which developed after Old English’s distinct term for the latter ({{m|ang|wer}}) fell out of use, has been criticized since at least the second half of the twentieth century.<ref name="Oxforddict">{{R:Lexico}}</ref> Critics claim that the use of “man”, both alone and in compounds, to denote a human or any gender “is now often regarded as sexist or at best old-fashioned”,<ref name="Oxforddict"/> “flatly discriminatory in that it slights or ignores the membership of women in the human race”.<ref name="Dict">{{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref> The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' wrote that in 2004 75-79% of their usage panel still accepted sentences with generic ''man'', and 86-87% accepted sentences with {{m|en|man-made}}.<ref>[//ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?id=M5074100 American Heritage Dictionary, 5th edition]</ref> Some style guides recommend against generic “man”,<ref>[//owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/608/05/ Purdue OWL]</ref> and “although some editors and writers reject or disregard [...] objections to man as a generic, many now choose instead to use” {{m|en|human}}, {{m|en|human being}} or {{m|en|person}} instead.<ref name="Dict"/>
** This generic usage is still preserved in certain dialects, [[pidgin]]s, and [[creole]]s of English, as well as fixed expressions and certain religious documents and declarations such as the [[w:Nicene Creed|Nicene Creed]] (e.g. "...for us '''men''' and our salvation..."). Consideration of this has sometimes led to accusations of the critics of the generic ''man'' as enforcing linguistic [[prescriptivism]].

==Dutch==
{{wikipedia|lang=nl}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|nl|dum|man}}, from {{inh|nl|odt|man}}, from {{inh|nl|gmw-pro|*mann}}, from {{inh|nl|gem-pro|*mann-}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{audio-IPA|nl|Nl-man.ogg|/mɑn/}}
* {{hyphenation|nl|man}}
* {{rhymes|nl|ɑn}}

===Noun===
{{nl-noun|m|-en|pl2=man|pl3=-s|mannetje|dim2=manneke|dim3=manneken}}

# [[#English|man]], human [[male]], either adult or age-irrespective
#: {{ux|nl|De oude '''man''' en de zee.|[[w:en:The Old Man and the Sea|The Old '''Man''' and the Sea]]}}
# [[husband]], male [[spouse]]

====Usage notes====
* The normal plural is ''mannen''. The unchanged form ''man'' is used after numerals only; it refers to the size of a group rather than a number of individuals. For example: ''In totaal verloren er 5000 <u>man</u> hun leven in die slag.'' (“5000 <u>men</u> altogether lost their lives in that battle.”) The plural ''mans'' is dated, now mostly occurring in nautical contexts or in dialect.
* Compound words with ''-man'' as their last component often take -{{m|nl|lieden}} or -{{m|nl|lui}} in the plural, rather than ''-mannen''. For example: {{m|nl|brandweerman||firefighter}} → {{m|nl|brandweerlieden}} (alongside {{m|nl|brandweerlui}} and {{m|nl|brandweermannen}}).
* Various alternative diminutives exist, including {{m|nl|manneke}} (used especially in Flanders) and the dialectal {{m|nl|mannechie}}.

* {{IPA|de|/man/}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|de|gmh|man}}, from {{inh|de|goh|man}}, from {{inh|de|gmw-pro|*mann}}, from {{inh|de|gem-pro|*mann-|t=man}}.

====Pronoun====
{{head|de|pronoun|cat2=indefinite pronouns}}

# [[one]], [[you]] {{gloss|''indefinite pronoun; construed as a third-person singular''}}
#: {{ux|de|'''Man''' kann nicht immer kriegen, was '''man''' will.|'''You''' can’t always get what '''you''' want.}}
#: {{ux|de|Manchmal muss '''man''' Kompromisse machen.|Sometimes '''one''' must compromise.}}

#: {{ux|de|Zumindest sagt '''man''' das so...|At least that’s what '''they''' say...}}
# [[someone]], [[somebody]] {{gloss|some unspecified person}}
# [[they]] {{gloss|some unspecified group of people}}

=====Usage notes=====
* '''''Man''''' is used in the nominative case only; for the oblique cases forms of the pronoun {{m|de|einer}} are used. For example: '''''Man''' kann nicht immer tun, was <u>einen</u> glücklich macht.'' — '''One''' cannot always do what makes <u>one</u> happy.
* Since '''''man''''' derives from the same source as {{m|de|Mann||man; male}}, its use is considered problematic by some feminists. They have proposed alternating ''man'' and the feminine neologism {{m|de|frau}}, or using the generic neologism {{m|de|mensch}}. This usage has gained some currency in feminist and left-wing publications, but remains rare otherwise.
* In the sense of “someone,” '''''man''''' is often translated using the passive voice (“I was told that...” rather than “'''someone''' told me that...”).

===Etymology 2===
From {{der|de|gml|man}}. A contraction of {{der|de|osx|newan||none other than}}. Compare a similar contraction in {{cog|nl|maar||only}}.

====Usage notes====
{{sense|adult male human}} The unchanged plural man is sometimes used after numerals. It means "men" as a measure for size or strength of a group rather than individuals:
:: {{uxi|sv|Med tre '''man''' kan vi lyfta byrån|With three '''people''' we can lift the cupboard}}
: Military or police personnel, team members, demonstrators and the like are often counted using this unchanged plural. The same goes with German where Mann can have an unchanged plural form in this particular case.
{{sense|husband}} Not used in other contexts, where could be confused with a man in general.

====Pronoun====
