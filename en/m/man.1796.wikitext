=====Usage notes=====
* The use of “man” to mean both “human (of any gender)” and “adult male”, which developed after Old English’s distinct term for the latter ({{m|ang|wer}}) fell out of use, has been criticized since at least the second half of the twentieth century.<ref name="Oxforddict">{{R:ODO}}</ref> The use of “man”, both alone and in compounds, to denote a human or any gender “is now often regarded as sexist or at best old-fashioned”,<ref name="Oxforddict"/> “flatly discriminatory in that it slights or ignores the membership of women in the human race”.<ref name="Dict">{{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref> The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' wrote that in 2004 75-79% of their usage panel still accepted sentences with generic ''man'', and 86-87% accepted sentences with {{m|en|man-made}}.<ref>[//ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?id=M5074100 American Heritage Dictionary, 5th edition]</ref> Some style guides recommend against generic “man”,<ref>[//owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/608/05/ Purdue OWL]</ref> and “although some editors and writers reject or disregard [...] objections to man as a generic, many now choose instead to use” {{m|en|human}}, {{m|en|human being}} or {{m|en|person}} instead.<ref name="Dict"/><!--That the most common modern sense of the word is ''adult male'' and not ''generic'' explains the awkwardness of sentences like "man, like other mammals, gives live birth" and "man breastfeeds his young".<ref>[//www.unh.edu/womens-commission/nonsexist.htm ''Nonsexist Language Guideline''], the University of New Hampshire.</ref>-->

===Pronunciation===
* {{audio-IPA|Nl-man.ogg|/mɑn/|lang=nl}}
* {{rhymes|ɑn|lang=nl}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|nl|dum|man}}, from {{inh|nl|odt|man}}, from {{inh|nl|gem-pro|*mann-}}.

===Noun===
{{nl-noun|m|-en|pl2=man|mannetje|dim2=manneke}}

#: ''De oude '''man''' en de zee.''
#:: [[w:en:The Old Man and the Sea|The Old '''Man''' and the Sea]].
# [[husband]], male [[spouse]]

====Usage notes====
* The normal plural is '''''mannen.''''' The unchanged form ''man'' is used after numerals only; it refers to the size of a group rather than a number of individuals. For example: ''In totaal verloren er 5000 <u>man</u> hun leven in die slag.'' (“5000 <u>men</u> altogether lost their lives in that battle.”)
* Compound words with ''-man'' as their last component often take -{{m|nl|lieden}} or -{{m|nl|lui}} in the plural, rather than ''-mannen''. For example: {{m|nl|brandweerman||firefighter}} → {{m|nl|brandweerlieden}} (alongside {{m|nl|brandweerlui}} and {{m|nl|brandweermannen}}).

==German==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/man/|lang=de}}
* {{audio|De-at-man.ogg|audio (Austria)|lang=de}}
* {{rhymes|an|lang=de}}
* {{homophones|Mann|lang=de}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|de|gmh|man}}, from {{inh|de|goh|man}}, from {{inh|de|gem-pro|*mann-||man}}, probably ultimately from {{der|de|ine-pro|*mon-}}. Originally the same word as {{m|de|Mann||man}}, which see for more. The same construct in {{cog|nl|men}}, {{cog|fr|on}}.

====Pronoun====
{{head|de|pronoun|cat2=indefinite pronouns}}

# [[one]]; [[you]]; [[they]]; [[people]] {{gloss|indefinite pronoun; construed as a third-person singular}}
#: '''''Man''' kann nicht immer kriegen, was '''man''' will.''
#:: '''You''' can’t always get what '''you''' want.
#: ''Manchmal muss '''man''' Kompromisse machen.''
#:: Sometimes '''one''' must compromise.
#: ''Zumindest sagt '''man''' das so...''
#:: At least that’s what '''they''' say...
#* '''2008''', Frank Behmeta, ''Wenn ich die Augen öffne'', page 55:
#*: Kann '''man''' es fühlen, wenn '''man''' schwanger ist?
#*:: Can '''one''' feel that '''one''' is pregnant?

=====Usage notes=====
* ''Man'' is used in the nominative case only; for the oblique cases forms of the pronoun {{m|de|einer}} are used. For example: ''<u>Man</u> kann nicht immer tun, was <u>einen</u> glücklich macht.'' (“One cannot always do what makes one happy.”)
* Since ''man'' derives from the same source as {{m|de|Mann||man; male}}, its use is considered problematic by some feminists. They have proposed alternating ''man'' and the feminine neologism {{m|de|frau}}, or using the generic neologism {{m|de|mensch}}. This usage has gained some currency in feminist and left-wing publications, but remains rare otherwise.

===Etymology 2===
From {{der|de|gml}}. A contraction of {{der|de|osx|newan||none other than}}. Compare a similar contraction in {{cog|nl|maar||only}}.

====Adverb====
{{head|de|adverb}}

# {{lb|de|colloquial|regional|northern Germany}} [[just]]; [[only]]
