=====Usage notes=====
* The use of “man” (compare [[Old English]]: {{l|ang|mann}}, {{l|ang|wer}}, {{l|ang|wīf}}) to mean both “human (of any gender)” and “adult male”, which developed after Old English’s distinct term for the latter ({{m|ang|wer}}) fell out of use, has been criticized since at least the second half of the twentieth century.<ref name="Oxforddict">{{R:Lexico}}</ref> Critics claim that the use of “man”, both alone and in compounds, to denote a human or any gender “is now often regarded as sexist or at best old-fashioned”,<ref name="Oxforddict"/> “flatly discriminatory in that it slights or ignores the membership of women in the human race”.<ref name="Dict">{{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref> The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' wrote that in 2004 75-79% of their usage panel still accepted sentences with generic ''man'', and 86-87% accepted sentences with {{m|en|man-made}}.<ref>[//ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?id=M5074100 American Heritage Dictionary, 5th edition]</ref> Some style guides recommend against generic “man”,<ref>[//owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/608/05/ Purdue OWL]</ref> and “although some editors and writers reject or disregard [...] objections to man as a generic, many now choose instead to use” {{m|en|human}}, {{m|en|human being}} or {{m|en|person}} instead.<ref name="Dict"/>
** This generic usage is still well-preserved in certain dialects, [[pidgin]]s, and [[creole]]s of English, as well as fixed expressions and certain religious documents and declarations such as the [[w:Nicene Creed|Nicene Creed]] (e.g. "...for us '''men''' and our salvation..."). Consideration of this has often led to accusations of the critics of the generic ''man'' as enforcing linguistic [[prescriptivism]].

====Usage notes====
* The normal plural is ''mannen''. The unchanged form ''man'' is used after numerals only; it refers to the size of a group rather than a number of individuals. For example: ''In totaal verloren er 5000 <u>man</u> hun leven in die slag.'' (“5000 <u>men</u> altogether lost their lives in that battle.”) The plural ''mans'' is dated, now mostly occurring in nautical contexts or in dialect.
* Compound words with ''-man'' as their last component often take -{{m|nl|lieden}} or -{{m|nl|lui}} in the plural, rather than ''-mannen''. For example: {{m|nl|brandweerman||firefighter}} → {{m|nl|brandweerlieden}} (alongside {{m|nl|brandweerlui}} and {{m|nl|brandweermannen}}).
* Various alternative diminutives exist, including {{m|nl|manneke}} (used especially in Flanders) and the dialectal {{m|nl|mannechie}}.

==German==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/man/}}
* {{a|Austria}} {{audio|de|De-at-man.ogg}}
* {{rhymes|de|an}}
* {{homophones|de|Mann}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|de|gmh|man}}, from {{inh|de|goh|man}}, from {{inh|de|gmw-pro|*mann}}, from {{inh|de|gem-pro|*mann-||man}}, probably ultimately from {{der|de|ine-pro|*mon-}}. Originally the same word as {{m|de|Mann||man}}, which see for more. The same construct in {{cog|nl|men}}, {{cog|fr|on}}.

====Pronoun====
{{head|de|pronoun|cat2=indefinite pronouns}}

# [[one]], [[you]] {{gloss|''indefinite pronoun; construed as a third-person singular''}}
#: '''''Man''' kann nicht immer kriegen, was '''man''' will.''
#:: '''You''' can’t always get what '''you''' want.
#: ''Manchmal muss '''man''' Kompromisse machen.''
#:: Sometimes '''one''' must compromise.
#* '''2008''', Frank Behmeta, ''Wenn ich die Augen öffne'', page 55:
#*: Kann '''man''' es fühlen, wenn '''man''' schwanger ist?
#*:: Can '''one''' feel that '''one''' is pregnant?
# [[they]], [[people]] {{gloss|people in general}}
#: ''Zumindest sagt '''man''' das so...''
#:: At least that’s what '''they''' say...
# [[someone]], [[somebody]] {{gloss|some unspecified person}}
# [[they]] {{gloss|some unspecified group of people}}

=====Usage notes=====
* '''''Man''''' is used in the nominative case only; for the oblique cases forms of the pronoun {{m|de|einer}} are used. For example: '''''Man''' kann nicht immer tun, was <u>einen</u> glücklich macht.'' — '''One''' cannot always do what makes <u>one</u> happy.
* Since '''''man''''' derives from the same source as {{m|de|Mann||man; male}}, its use is considered problematic by some feminists. They have proposed alternating ''man'' and the feminine neologism {{m|de|frau}}, or using the generic neologism {{m|de|mensch}}. This usage has gained some currency in feminist and left-wing publications, but remains rare otherwise.
* In the sense of “someone,” '''''man''''' is often translated using the passive voice (“I was told that...” rather than “'''someone''' told me that...”).

===Etymology 2===
From {{der|de|gml|man}}. A contraction of {{der|de|osx|newan||none other than}}. Compare a similar contraction in {{cog|nl|maar||only}}.
