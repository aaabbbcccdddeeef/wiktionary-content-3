===Etymology===
[[portmanteau word|Portmanteau]] of [[metropolitan]] and [[heterosexual]].

===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[metro-|metro]][[sexual]]}}
<!-- what is this? [[de:Metrosexualität]] -->

# A man concerned with personal appearance, such as personal grooming, fashion, and aesthetics in general; who may or may not be concerned with self-indulgence and money. (Usually [[urban]], [[heterosexual]], often [[affluent]]). <!--  A concern for personal image is interpreted socially as being "homosexual" in some social circles, leaving "Gay Straight Male" as the logical terminology in that social context to describe a straight male concerned with fashion and personal appearance.-->
# A man who is seen, [[sociologically]], as having attributes common to [[homosexuals]], but is in fact [[heterosexual]].

====Usage notes====
* Although {{term||metrosexual}} derives from a blend of {{term|metropolitan|lang=en}} + {{term|heterosexual|lang=en}}, the {{term||metr-}} element of {{term||metropolitan}} ultimately derives from the Ancient Greek word {{term|sc=polytonic|μήτηρ|tr=mētēr||mother|lang=grc}}; consequently, those familiar with its classical etymology are liable to snigger or raise their eyebrows at hearing a term which, literally, conveys a sense something like a genteel {{term|mother fucker|lang=en}}.

====Synonyms====
* {{l|en|boulevardier}}
* [[dandy]] - (19th Century ?)
* [[fop]] - (19th Century ?)
* [[dude]], [[dood]] (archaic)
* {{l|en|man about town}}
* [[masher]] (''archaic'')
