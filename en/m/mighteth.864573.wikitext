===Etymology===
{{suffix|might|eth|lang=en}}.

===Verb===

# {{lb|en|nonstandard|pseudo-archaic|hypercorrect}} {{form of|third-person singular simple past|may|lang=en}}

====Usage notes====
* This verb form is nonstandard, because the English past tense does not distinguish singular and plural persons with any suffixes &mdash; except for the verb [[be]] (''[[was]]'' vs. ''[[were]]'').
