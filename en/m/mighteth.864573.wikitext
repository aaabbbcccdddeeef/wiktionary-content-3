# {{lb|en|nonstandard|pseudo-archaic|hypercorrect}} {{en-archaic third-person singular of|may}}.

====Usage notes====
* This verb form is nonstandard, because the English past tense does not distinguish singular and plural persons with any suffixes &mdash; except for the verb [[be]] (''[[was]]'' vs. ''[[were]]'').
