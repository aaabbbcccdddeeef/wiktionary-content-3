# {{context|archaic|nonstandard|lang=en}} {{form of|third-person singular simple past|may|lang=en}}

====Usage notes====
* This verb form is nonstandard, because the English past tense does not distinguish singular and plural persons with any suffixes &mdash; except for the verb [[be]] (''[[was]]'' vs. ''[[were]]'').
