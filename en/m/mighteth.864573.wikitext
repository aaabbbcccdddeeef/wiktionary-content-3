# {{lb|en|nonstandard|pseudo-archaic|hypercorrect}} {{en-archaic third-person singular of|may}}.

====Usage notes====
* This verb form is nonstandard; the historical third-person singular past tense of verbs was always identical to the first-person singular, unlike the present tense. Contrastively, second-person singular "mightest" is historically correct.
