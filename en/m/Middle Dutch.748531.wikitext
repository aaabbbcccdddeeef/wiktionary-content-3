# Collective name for a number of closely related West [[Germanic]] [[dialect]]s (whose ancestor was [[Old Dutch]]) which were spoken and written between 1150 and 1500 in the present-day Dutch-speaking area. There was at that time as yet no overarching standard language, but they were all mutually intelligible.
