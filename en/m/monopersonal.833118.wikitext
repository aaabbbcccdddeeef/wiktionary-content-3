E. Booij, Christian Lehmann, Joachim Mugdan|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=650|text=Grammars of several languages traditionally list a subcategory of '''monopersonal''' verbs that occur only in the third-person but not in the first or second. Some such verbs do not even occur in the third-person plural. For instance, Finnish has several subtypes of '''monopersonal''' verbs, here all listed in the third person singular (marked by lenghthening of the stem-vowel): (a) modal verbs such as ''pitä-ä'' 'must', ''täyty-y'' 'must', ''kannatta-a'' 'is worth', ''kelpä-ä'' 'be suitable, be fitting, do'; (b) morphologically derived causatives (with the suffix -tutta or -tta) expressing various pysiological or mental states, such as ''aivastutta-a'' 'be about to sneeze, make somebody sneeze', ''heikotta-a'' 'feel weak, make somebody feel week', ''kadutta-a'' 'regret, make to feel sorry for'; (c) meterological and equivalent verbs such as ''sata-a'' 'rain', ''myrskyä-ä'' 'storm', ''liplatteke-e'' 'splash <nowiki>[of waves]</nowiki>'. The verbs in (a) occur only in the third person singular, those in (c) also do not have the so-called passive forms with the suffix ''-ta/-tä'' and the person marker ''-Vn'', actually expressing an indefinite agent ("fourth person"), hypothetically *''sade-ta-an'' 'one rains', *''liplatel-la-an'' 'one splashes', *''kadute-ta-an'' 'one is made to feel regret'.}}
