Either originally borrowed as [[masher]], from {{term|masha}}, or from {{suffix|mash|er}}. Leland writes of the etymology:<ref>Preface to poem “The Masher”.</ref>
:It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors, C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word “masher” or “mash” means in that tongue to allure, delude, or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be no doubt as to the gypsy origin of “mash” as used on the stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-known impresario [Albert Marshall] Palmer of New York, and I made a note of it years before the term had become at all popular.
