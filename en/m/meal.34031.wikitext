=====Usage notes=====
* In the third sense, ''meal'' is a {{glossary|fossil word}} and is usually found in the archaic/obsolete phrase "at every (ilk a) meal" meaning "on every occasion", confer also "at ilk a tide". It fell out of common usage in the late 15th century. Also, "at one meal" sometimes meant {{m|en|at a time}}, {{m|en|at once}}, {{m|en|at one time}} or {{m|en|in one go}}; see also {{cog|de|auf einmal|lit=upon one meal}}. "To keep (the) meal" probably used to mean "to use/spend one's time". A "sorry meal" used to mean a "grim occasion" such as a fight, setback, mishap or some sort of other misfortune.

* ''Meal'', in the sense of "time" or "occasion", also survives in other set phrases, such as {{m|en|piecemeal||one piece at a time}}, {{m|en|footmeal||one foot at a time}}, {{m|en|heapmeal||in large numbers}} etc.
