===Etymology===
Literally: "General Mines". Two origins are proposed:
* Literal meaning: the mines spread in several spots around a larger region
* From ''Minas dos Matos Gerais'' ("Mines of the General Woods"), which encompasses the region of "Mines" and the region of "General Woods" (or "General Fields"), which were farther from mines and harder to access.
