# {{l|en|merguez}}
# In French police slang, the word ''merguez'' is used to describe a car that has been modified—such as filing away its engine number, or the inclusion of components from different cars—to make it hard to identify and correspondingly enhance its suitability for use in crimes.<ref>{{cite-web

# Elsewhere in France ''merguez'' may be used to define a used car that has been involved in an accident and then repaired in a way that conceals the accident damage, in order to avoid a diminution in the vehicle's value. By extension, the term is sometimes used to describe a seemingly normal transaction that later turns out to be a scam.
