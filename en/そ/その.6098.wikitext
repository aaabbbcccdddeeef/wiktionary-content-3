====Usage notes====
* その is anaphorically used to refer to things and experiences that either the speaker or the listener knows about, but not both. Compare the two following sentences,
*: '''その'''本はやすいですか？
*:: Is that book which you (have/saw/were talking about) cheap? ''(anaphorically)''
*:: Is that book (I'm pointing to/near you/of yours) cheap? ''(deictically)''
*: '''あの'''本はやすいですか？
*:: Is the book (we are talking about) cheap? ''(anaphorically)''
*:: Is that book (over there, which you and I can see) cheap? ''(deictically)''
* The hiragana spelling ([[その]]) is preferred to the kanji spelling ([[其の]]), which is rarely used.
