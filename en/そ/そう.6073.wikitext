====Usage notes====
This productive suffix meaning ''seeming like'' can come after a full phrase in plain form, or after a verb or adjective stem, thereby forming a "-na" adjective.

* After a full phrase in plain form, the resulting phrase implies reported speech, something heard from someone else. For example, the verb {{l|ja|降る|tr=''furu'', "to fall from the sky"}} plus this suffix forms 降る'''そう''' (''furu '''sō''''', "'''I've heard that''' it will rain" or "'''someone told me that''' it will rain"). The adjective {{l|ja|美味しい|tr=''oishii'', "delicious"}} plus this suffix forms 美味しい'''そう''' (''oishii '''sō''''', "'''I've heard that''' it's delicious").

* After a verb or adjective stem, the resulting word means ''it looks like X''. For example, the stem 降り of the verb {{l|ja|降る|tr=''furu'', "to fall from the sky"}} plus this suffix forms 降り'''そう''' (''furi'''sō''''', "it '''looks''' like it will rain"). The stem 美味し of the adjective {{l|ja|美味しい|tr=''oishii'', "delicious"}} plus this suffix forms 美味し'''そう''' (''oishi'''sō''''', "'''looks''' delicious").

The suffix should not be used after stem forms describing visually obvious physical traits like color. Although 赤い'''そう''' (''akai '''sō''''', "'''I've heard that''' it's red") would be valid, *赤'''そう''' (''aka'''sō''''', "it '''looks''' red") would not. It should, however, be used when describing another person's mood or mental state. For example, if another person looks glad, one says 嬉し'''そう''' (''ureshi'''sō''''', "you '''look''' glad"), which is more natural and polite than saying {{l|ja|嬉しい|tr=''ureshii'', "you are glad"}}.

===Verb===

# {{ja-def|添う|副う}} to [[accompany]]; to [[comply]] with
# {{ja-def|沿う}} to [[follow]]; to [[run]] [[along]]
