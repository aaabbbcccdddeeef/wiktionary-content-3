====Usage notes====
This productive suffix, of sense number one, comes after masu stems and adjectives, and forms quasi-adjectives, also called -na adjectives.  For example the verb {{l|ja|降る|tr=ふる, furu|gloss=precipitate}} plus this suffix forms ふりそうな ("it looks like it will rain"), and the adjective {{l|ja|美味しい|tr=おいしい, oishii|gloss=delicious}} plus this suffix forms 美味しそうな ("looks delicious.") 

The suffix should not be used to describe obvious physical traits like color, for example <strike>赤そうな</strike>.  It should, however, be used when describing another person's mood or mental state.  For example, if another person looks glad, one says 嬉しそう (うれしそう, ureshisō) ("you look glad"), which is more natural and more polite than saying {{l|ja|嬉しい|tr=うれしい, ureshii|gloss=you are glad}}.

{{ja-verb|h|type=1|rom=sou}}

# {{ja-def|添う}} to [[accompany]]; to [[comply]] with
# {{ja-def|沿う}} to [[follow]]; to [[run]] [[along]]
