====Quotations====
* '''1925''', John Dewey. ''Experience and Nature'' In The Later Works of John Dewey, Vol. 1, Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale (IL), p. 150:
*: When we name an event, calling it fire, we speak '''proleptically'''; we do not name an immediate event; that is impossible. We employ a term of discourse; we invoke a meaning, namely, the potential consequence of the existence.
* '''1989''', W. Paul Jones. ''Theological Worlds'' Abingdon Press, Nashville, p. 151:
*: In World Two, Jesus can be seen as the '''proleptic''' event, giving promise of God's vindication of creation in and through history.
