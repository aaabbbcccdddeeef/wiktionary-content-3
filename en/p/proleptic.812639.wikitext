A '''Proleptic''' [[calendar]] or [[era]] is that calendar extrapolated to dates prior the its first adoption.  For example, the [[Battle of Hastings]] was fought on [[October 14]], [[1066]], according to the [[Julian calendar]] in use at the time.  One could also refer to it by the [[Proleptic Gregorian Calendar|proleptic Gregorian]] date of October 8, even though the [[Gregorian calendar]] was not actually adopted until [[1582]].  

Similarly, dates such as AD [[306]] or [[44 BC]] are examples of proleptic use of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which was developed in [[525]].
