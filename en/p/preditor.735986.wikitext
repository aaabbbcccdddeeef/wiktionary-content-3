====Noun====
{{en-noun}}

# In the entertainment industry, a job title that combines both the duties of a producer and an editor, and depending on the skills of the individual, the duties of a producer, a writer and an editor.

Preditors are becoming more and more common due to the rise of [[reality television]].  
Usually an editor is given a detailed [[script]] to cut from, but a preditor is often given only an [[outline]] and is expected to create the story.
On non scripted documentaries, a preditor can work without supervision to create the story outline, as well as write and edit the film.
