A term used in the entertianment industry to describe a job that combines both the duties of an "editor" and a "story producer" or writer.  Preditors are becoming more and more common thanks to the rise of reality TV.  Usually an editor is given a detailed script to cut from, but a preditor is often given only an outline and is expected to create the story himself.
