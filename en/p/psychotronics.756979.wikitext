# The study of the formation and functioning of the human mind (in the classical philosophy-Mind-Body Problem); the psychics define it as
interaction between [[matter]], [[energy]] and the [[mind]], especially the supposed relationship in [[parapsychological]] effects. <br>
Due to the interactive nature of the human instincts (instinct of individual preservation; instinct to kill (aggression); instinct to continuation of the species (sex); mathernial instinct (to preserve the generation)) most of the psychics and their clients, dealing with this type of knowledge switch-over from phenomenology (study of the personal experience and skills acquisition) to misuse with the interactivity of the instincts ... and can even start teaching other people (with or without their knowledge of what they are actually doing) how to practice misuse of any kind (ranging from mania to control 'the things', going through grandomania ... and reaching the development of psychotronic weapons of any kind). <br>
When a given debillian is acquainted with some psychotronic techniques, usually he/she could not stop misusing with them.
