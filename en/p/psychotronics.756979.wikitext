The technical vocabulary could be enriched soon with this new term? It is offered in the number of last November's 'Vie des Métiers' (which broadly translates into "Life of profession") by our colleague and spiritual friend Fernand Clerc that writes: 'Electricity, electronics, cybernetics.. and then?.. Propose Psychotronics, as 'use of thought and will'. Brain currents are detected and measured at the micro-volts. Dowsers and yogis are said to be already able, without intermediary, without amplification, only by the concentration of their thought, of dropping a droplet to the right or left of a razor blade. Dr. of Science André Sainte-Lagué says each of us has the ability to produce these infinitesimal actions at a distance. It will not be long for a sheltered from external disturbances desire of pressure to activate relays and servo motors. The heavy doors of the Chicago World Fair were opened to 'the appointed hour by the passage of the star Aldebaran instead calculated by astronomers'. It will one day be thought of President of the Republic who will operate the printed microwave circuits, embraced by the doors of the Psychotronics Applied Salon. The word is formed with a rare etymological happiness. If the "thing" becomes real, you know, thanks to Fernand Clerc, how to call it."</ref><ref>[[w:Zdeněk Rejdák|Zdeněk Rejdák]], [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000107/010749eo.pdf ''Psychotronics: the state of the art''], ([[UNESCO]], 1974): "We specialists in the field decided to adopt the term 'psychotronics' proposed, by the French engineer Fernand Clerc, in the radio-technical journal Toute la Radio. 'Parapsychology' thus reverts, like mesmerism or metapsychology, to the description of a stage of development of psychotronics."</ref> which speculated on the possibility of [[telekinesis]], particularly operating microwave [[printed circuit board]]s by [[concentration]]. 

In the late 1960s, the term was popular among parapsychology researchers of the socialist bloc (particularly [[w:Zdeněk Rejdák|Zdeněk Rejdák]]), used instead of ''[[parapsychology]]'' to avoid its negative connotations and "advance parapsychology as a science" (as stated in the Constitution of the [[w:Parapsychological Association|Parapsychological Association]] in 1957) and because the incorporation of the word ''electronics'' better conveyed the focus on energy,<!--{cn}--> and (according to parapsychology researcher Larissa Vilenskaya in 1983) because the term analogized parapsychology to [[bionics]].<ref name="Larissa">Larissa Vilenskaya, ''Psi Research: An East - West Journal on Parapsycology, Psychotronics and Psychobiophysics (1983) [p. 107]'', cited in ''[http://parapsych.org/articles/53/357/psychotronics.aspx Psychotronics - The Parapsychological Association]''</ref> 
The term was then popularized in western world during the second half of the [[Cold War]] by science fiction and fears of [[mind control]].
