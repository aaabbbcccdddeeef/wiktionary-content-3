#  The definition of psshaw is "whatever", "you don't mean it" or "bull".  It is a colloquialism native to the Ozarks in Missouri.  You would use it in a sentence as; "Oh, psshaw, I don't believe a word you are saying".  It was more commonly used in rural areas in the 1900s.  My grandparents used it often, as they did not use cuss words.  Frankie Davis, Missouri
