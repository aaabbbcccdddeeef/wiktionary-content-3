===Etymology===
From Middle English {{term|peple}}, from {{etyl|xno}} ''[[people]]'', from {{etyl|fro}} {{term|pueple|lang=fro}} / {{term|pople|lang=fro}} (modern French {{term|peuple|lang=fr}}), from {{etyl|la}} {{term|populus|lang=la}}, probably from Etruscan. <!-- Ultimately related to Old English {{term|þeod}}. Wait, how is this, if this is from Etruscan? --> Use of the term as a plural for the word ''[[person]]'' is an example of [[w:Suppletion|suppletion]].
