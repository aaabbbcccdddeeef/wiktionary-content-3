===Etymology===
May have originated with the game of [[poker]], in which a [[marker]] or [[counter]], frequently in frontier days a knife with a buckhorn handle, was used to indicate the person whose turn it was to deal. If the player did not wish to deal he could pass the responsibility by passing the "buckhorn" or "[[buck]]", as the marker came to be called, to the next player.
