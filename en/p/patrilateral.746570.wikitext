Term describing kin (relatives) 'on the father's side'.

Where the dominant way of describing inheritance in a society is through the mother's line ([[matrilineal]] inheritance), this will typically be balanced by particular ways of understanding the relationships with the father's (patrilateral) kin. This complementarity of kin reckoning is visible likewise in how [[patrilineal]]ly organised social groups will need to take account of [[matrilateral]] relationships.
