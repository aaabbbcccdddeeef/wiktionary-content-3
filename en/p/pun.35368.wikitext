# A joke or type of [[wordplay]] in which two similarly pronounced words or phrases are deliberately confused.

==== Examples ====
''Note: Because puns are based on pronunciation, puns are more obvious when spoken aloud.''
*This rock is [[gneiss]], but don't take it for [[granite]] (which reads (with a US accent) similarly to "This rock is nice, but don't take it for granted"; "gneiss" and "granite" are both types of rock)
