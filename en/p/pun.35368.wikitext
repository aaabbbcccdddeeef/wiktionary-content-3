# A joke or type of [[wordplay]] in which similar senses or sounds of two words or phrases, or different senses of the same word, are deliberately confused.

====Examples====
''Note: Because some puns are based on pronunciation, puns are more obvious when spoken aloud.''
*This rock is [[gneiss]], but don’t take it for [[granite]] (which reads (with a US accent) similarly to "This rock is nice, but don’t take it for granted"; "gneiss" and "granite" are both types of rock)
* "It’s hard being the Queen"<br>"I know what you mean. Especially in these pants."<br>Cheech & Chong’s '''The Corsican Brothers''' [http://mgmua.com/audiotrax.do?wma=CORSICA-CL02_Queen.wma&artist=Cheech%20Marin%20(Luis),%20Edie%20McClurg%20(the%20Queen)&title=CORSICA-CL02_Queen.wma&desc=CORSICA-CL02_Queen.wma]
