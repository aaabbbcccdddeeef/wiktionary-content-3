===Etymology===
From {{inh|fr|frm|puy}}, from {{inh|fr|fro|puy||hill, height}}, {{m|fro|pui}}, from {{inh|fr|la|podium}}. Its current use as a regionalism referring to certain geographic features may be taken at least in part from {{der|fr|frp|-}}; cf. also Occitan {{m|oc|puèg}}. In Old French, it had a somewhat different or more varied set of meanings (cf. also the feminine {{m|fro|puie}}, {{m|fro|puye}}, {{m|fro|poye||balustrade}}, whence English {{m|en|pew}} through Anglo-Norman), later coming to be applied to mountains and hills especially in the Auvergne region and Massif Central, the remains of extinct volcanoes. Doublet of the later borrowing {{doublet|podium|lang=fr|notext=1}}.
