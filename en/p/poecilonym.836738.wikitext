# Almost a [[synonym]]: a word that means almost the same thing as another.
#* {{quote-book|en|year=1977|author=Robert H. Stacy|title=Defamiliarization in Language and Literature|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XWhZAAAAMAAJ|page=52|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815621843
|passage=This is also a type of '''poecilonym''' or hybrid word; cf. such a word as “[[aeneolithic]]” (=[[chalcolithic]]) in English.}}
#* '''1997''', David Grambs, ''The Endangered English Dictionary: Bodacious Words'', page xi:
#*: Maybe we could all use a few spanking old '''poecilonyms'''. '''Poecilonym'''? It's an old synonym for synonym that you'll find in these pages. But many words in this dictionary have no real counterparts in today's English.
#* '''1999''' July 27, "Ucalegon" (username), "Missing aircraft", in {{monospace|alt.anagrams}}, ''Usenet'':
#*: &gt;&gt; Is there another word for synonym?
#*: &gt;Actually, there is: '''poecilonym'''
#*: Take care, though; ‘'''poecilonym'''’ can only be used for the taxonomic meaning of ‘synonym’--an incorrect or obsolete systematic name for a genus or species.
#* {{quote-book|en|year=2006|author=Nero Blanc|title=Death on the Diagonal|page=147|passage=It's high time I looked for another job and got as far away from homonyms, synonyms, antonyms — to say nothing of caconyms, eponyms, and '''poecilonyms'''!}}
