====Usage notes====
* Verb sense {{m-self|en|put up|id=put up a fight|3=7}} is a set phrase (verb + particle) that always jointly precede a direct object, which usually is an indefinite nominal meaning some type of resistance (e.g. a fight, a stoic defence, the strongest denunciation). Verb sense {{m-self|en|put up|id=cajole|3=4}} is also very idiomatic, always taking a direct object before the particle as well as the preposition "to" + indirect object after it (put someone up to something). Most of the verb senses are not so restricted—their direct object can appear before or after the particle (unless that object is a definite pronoun, which [https://en.wikipedia.org/English%20phrasal%20verbs#Distinguishing%20phrasal%20verb%20types as a rule comes before the particle]). The last transitive senses {{m-self|en|put up|id=hunting|3=12}}–{{m-self|en|put up|id=printing|3=15}} are specific to particular fields, historical periods, etc.
