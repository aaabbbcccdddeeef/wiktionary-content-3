#*: Who is there who has not jeered at the House of Lords, the military caste, the Royal Family, the '''public schools''', the huntin′ and shootin′ people, the old ladies in Cheltenham boarding houses, the horrors of ‘county’ society and the social hierarchy generally?

#*: Year by year, but especially in 1958, Labour Party statements said that ‘Labour must no longer hesitate to tackle the greatest source of social inequality and class division in our society – the private schools.’ But they did hesitate, even though the leaders of Labour were guilty '''public-school''' men themselves.  The majority of Labour party members attended the state funded Grammar schools in this period.  They won a scholarship.

#*: When I was a boy '''public schools''' were the only means of entry into the corridors of power.  This statement is not entirely correct.  Many state funded Grammar schools produced pupils who were high achievers.
#* '''1979''', James MacGregor Burns, ''Leadership'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ptUJAQAAMAAJ&q=%22public+school%22|%22public+schools%22+-intitle:%22public%22+-inauthor:%22%22&dq=%22public+school%22|%22public+schools%22+-intitle:%22public%22+-inauthor:%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NQXwT9rbMa2eiAeLiK2zDQ&redir_esc=y page 97],
#*: The striking aspect of the '''public school''' was the “unconscious” engineering that led to magnificent social opportunities for a chosen few males of the middle class and helped reinforce social deprivation and political frustration for Britain′s working classes.  The working class pupils of merit attended Grammar schools and were a match for the nepotism that existed then and now in the public school world.  The social engineering was deliberate and political and continues today in all levels of education in the UK.  Some institutions enact "affirmative action" to open opportunities to students who fall short of optimum entry criteria.
