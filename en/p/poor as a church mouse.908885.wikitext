===Etymology===
Alteration of earlier {{m|en|hungry as a church mouse}}, from the fact that [[Catholic]] (and [[Orthodox]]) priests are called to [[scrupulously]] prevent any crumb of the [[sacrament]] of [[Eucharist]] (the bread which is understood to be [[Christ]]'s body) from falling on the [[altar]] or to the ground, meaning that church mice had no crumbs to feed on.
