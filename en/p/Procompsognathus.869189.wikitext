==English==
===Etymology===
Back-formation of {{Gr.}} [[προ]] ([[pro]] - before) and [[compsognathus]], which was itself coined from [[κομψος]] ([[kompsos]] - "[[elegant]]", "[[refined]]" or "[[dainty]]"), and [[γναθος]] ([[gnathos]] - "[[jaw]]")).

===Noun===
{{wikipedia}}
{{en-noun|procompsognathi}}
# A species of small, [[bipedal]], [[dinosaur]] that lived during the Late [[Triassic]] Period, about 222 to 219 million years ago.

====Usage notes====
Although the word was coined to suggest that this dinosaur was a direct ancestor of [[compsognathus]], no evolutionary link has been proved to demonstrate such a heritage.
