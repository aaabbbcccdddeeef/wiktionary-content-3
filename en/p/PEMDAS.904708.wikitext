# {{lb|en|mnemonic}} {{n-g|An [[acronym]] used by [[mathematics]] students to remember the [[order of operations]]: [[parentheses]], then [[exponent]]s, then [[multiplication]] and [[division]], then [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]}}

====Usage notes====
This mnemonic leads many to the error that multiplication is precedent to division, and addition to subtraction; however, these are within the pairs equal in precedence and resolved from left to right. (E.g., 6-3+2 = (6-3)+2, 6/3*2 = (6/3)*2, so here subtraction is done after addition, and division is done before multiplication.)

====Synonyms====
* {{l|en|please excuse my dear Aunt Sally}}
* {{l|en|BODMAS}}
* {{l|en|BOMDAS}}
* {{l|en|BEDMAS}}
