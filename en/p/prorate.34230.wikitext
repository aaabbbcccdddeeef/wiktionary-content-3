# To [[divide]] [[proportionately]], especially by [[day]].
It is widely used by service companies. For example, you pay monthly $100 for some service. If you call to cancel the service on the i-th day of your billing cycle, the company will prorate your charges, meaning you'll have to pay only (i/30) times $100.
