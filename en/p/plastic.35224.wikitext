===Etymology===
Latin plasticus of molding, from Greek ''[[plastikos]]'', from ''[[plassein]]'' to mold, form.

The common sense of ''plastic'' as a material was derived by shortening the term ''thermoplastic'', a term used to describe that subset of common ''plastics'' that soften when heated.  (The other major subset of ''plastics'' is the ''thermosetting'' plastics, [[Bakelite]] being the best known example.
