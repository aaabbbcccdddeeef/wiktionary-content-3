Textual critics and analysts use the term 'periblepsis' to describe a condition in which a person handcopying a text accidentally skips over some of it.  Periblepsis can be the result of any number of mistakes and can be quite common when copying large amounts of text.

Periblepsis is an acknowledged factor in the possible misrepresentation of many ancient texts as accidents likely accumulated through time.  Examples of these possibly altered texts include, but are not limited to, the [[Quran]], the [[Torah]] and the [[Bible]].
