'''Periblepsis''' is a term used by textual critics and analysts to describe a condition in which a person handcopying a text accidentally skips over some of it.  Periblepsis can be the result of any number of mistakes and can be quite common when copying large amounts of text.
==Impact==
Periblepsis is an acknowledged factor in the possible misrepresentation of many [[ancient]] [[texts]] because such accidents are likely accumulated over time.  Examples of these possibly altered texts include, but are not limited to, the [[Quran]], the [[Torah]] and the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite web
