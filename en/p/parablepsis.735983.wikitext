'''Parablepsis''' which comes from the Greek words '''para-''' ("beside") and '''blepein''' ("to look") and refers to a circumstance in which a scribe miscopies text due to inadvertently looking to the side while copying. (sometimes misspelled as '''Periblepsis''', which would mean "looking around.") This misspelling may be found in Bart D. Ehrman's book ''Misquoting Jesus''. '''Parablepsis''' is used by textual critics and analysts to describe a condition in which a person handcopying a text accidentally skips over some of it.  It may be the result of any number of mistakes and can be quite common when copying large amounts of text.
==Impact==
Textual critics acknowledge that parablepsis is a factor in the possible mistranscription of many [[ancient]] [[Writing|texts]].<ref>{{cite web
