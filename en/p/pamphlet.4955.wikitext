The {{glossary|noun}} is derived from Late {{inh|en|enm|pamflet}}, {{m|enm|pamphilet|t=short written text; small book; tract}}{{nb...|pamfelet, pamfilet, panflet, pampelet, pamphilett, pamplet, pamplett, paunflet, paunflete|otherforms=1}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=pamflet|pos=n|id=MED32276}}</ref> from {{der|en|frm|Pamphilet}} (compare {{cog|LL.|-}} ([[w:Anglo-Latin literature|Anglo-Latin]]) {{m|LL.|pamfletus}}, {{m|LL.|panfletus}}, {{m|LL.|paunflettus|t=short written text}}, {{cog|fro|Panfilès}}), a popular shorthand for the 12th-century Latin love poem ''[[w:Pamphilus de amore|Pamphilus, seu de amore]]'' (''Pamphilus, or On Love''), which was so widely circulated in pamphlets as to give its name to the whole phenomenon. {{m|frm||Pamphilet}} is derived from {{der|en|la|Pamphilus}}, the name of a protagonist of the poem + {{der|en|frm|-et|pos={{glossary|suffix}} forming {{glossary|diminutive}} {{glossary|masculine}} nouns}};<ref name="OED">{{R:OED Online|pos=n|id=136613|date=December 2021|nodot=1}}; {{R:Lexico|pos=n}}</ref> while {{m|la||Pamphilus}} is from {{der|en|grc|Πάμφιλος|lit=beloved by all}}, from {{m|grc|παν-|pos={{glossary|prefix}} meaning ‘all; every’}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*peh₂-|t=to protect; to shepherd}}) + {{m|grc|φῐ́λος|t=beloved, dear}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*bʰil-|t=decent; friendly; good; harmonious}}).

For the Middle French and Old French use of the suffix {{m|frm|-et}} to form shorthands for the titles of works, compare {{noncog|frm|Avionet|t=the fables of Avianus}} from {{w|Avianus}}; {{noncog|frm|Catonet}}, {{noncog|fro|Chatonnet}}, {{m|fro|Chatonez|t=the {{w|Distichs of Cato}}}} from {{l|fro|Caton}} (they were formerly believed to be by {{w|Cato}}); and {{noncog|fro|Esopet}}, {{m|fro|Isopet|t=[[w:Aesop's Fables|Aesop’s Fables]]}} from {{m|fro|Ésope}} ({{w|Aesop}}).<ref name="OED"/>
