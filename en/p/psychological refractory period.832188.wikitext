An experimental effect discovered by cognitive psychologists which demonstrates that people have striking limitations in their ability to "multi-task" even with very simple tasks.  The effect arises when a person is required to perform two simple tasks in close temporal succession, with the stimulus for the first task occurring shortly before the stimulus for the second task.  (A "simple task" might be something like naming the color in which a square is printed, or saying "high" or "low" in response to a high-pitched or low-pitched tone.)  The psychological refractory period effect consists of a rise in the person's reaction time to respond to the second stimulus, when the interval between the two stimuli is shortened.  Parallel processing on the two tasks would imply that reaction times to both stimuli would be independent of the interval.  The actual result--a greater response time to the second task when the interval is short--implies some sort of serial processing, and psychologists have done many experiments to unravel the nature of this serial processing "bottleneck".
