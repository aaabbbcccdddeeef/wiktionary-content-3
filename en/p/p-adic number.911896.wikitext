# {{context|mathematics|lang=en}} An element of a [[completion]] of the field of [[rational number]]s which has a [[p-adic ultrametric|''p''-adic ultrametric]] as its [[metric]].<ref>'''2008''', Jacqui Ramagge, [http://www.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@inf/@math/documents/web/uow061321.pdf Unreal numbers: The story of ''p''-adic numbers]</ref>
#: The expansion (21)2121<sub>''p''</sub> is equal to the rational <b>''p''-adic number</b> <math>{2 p + 1 \over p^2 - 1}</math>.
#: In the set of [[p-adic number|3-adic numbers]], the closed ball of radius 1/3 "centered" at 1, call it ''B'', is the set <math> \{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 3 n + 1 \} </math>.  This closed ball partitions into exactly three smaller closed balls of radius 1/9: <math>\{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 1 + 9 n \} </math>, <math>\{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 4 + 9 n \}</math>, and <math>\{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 7 + 9 n \} </math>.  Then each of those balls partitions into exactly 3 smaller closed balls of radius 1/27, and the sub-partitioning can be continued indefinitely, in a fractal manner.<br>Likewise, going upwards in the hierarchy, ''B'' is part of the closed ball of radius 1 centered at 1, namely, the set of integers.  Two other closed balls of radius 1 are "centered" at 1/3 and 2/3, and all three closed balls of radius 1 form a closed ball of radius 3, <math>\{x| \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 1 + {n\over 3} \} </math>, which is one out of three closed balls forming a closed ball of radius 9, and so on. 

====Usage notes====
* The '<i>p</i>' in "''p''-adic" is a parameter which stands for a positive integer, preferably a [[prime number]].
* For a fixed prime value of ''p'', a <b>''p''-adic number</b> is a member of the [[field]] <math>\mathbb{Q}_p</math> which is a completion of the set of rational numbers.
* For a composite value of ''p'', a <b>''p''-adic number</b> is a member of a ring which is an extension of the field of rational numbers. <!-- Is it also a completion? --> 

====Hyponyms====
