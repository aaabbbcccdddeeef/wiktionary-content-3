# {{lb|en|number theory}} An element of a [[completion]] of the field of [[rational number]]s with respect to a [[p-adic ultrametric|''p''-adic ultrametric]].<ref>'''2008''', Jacqui Ramagge, [http://www.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@inf/@math/documents/web/uow061321.pdf Unreal numbers: The story of ''p''-adic numbers]</ref>
#: {{ux|en|The expansion (21)2121<sub>''p''</sub> is equal to the rational <b>''p''-adic number</b> <math>\textstyle{2 p + 1 \over p^2 - 1}.</math>}}
#: ''In the set of [[p-adic number|3-adic numbers]], the closed ball of radius 1/3 "centered" at 1, call it ''B'', is the set <math>\textstyle\{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 3 n + 1 \}.</math> This closed ball partitions into exactly three smaller closed balls of radius 1/9: <math>\{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 1 + 9 n \},</math> <math>\{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 4 + 9 n \},</math> and <math>\{x | \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 7 + 9 n \}.</math> Then each of those balls partitions into exactly 3 smaller closed balls of radius 1/27, and the sub-partitioning can be continued indefinitely, in a fractal manner.<br>Likewise, going upwards in the hierarchy, ''B'' is part of the closed ball of radius 1 centered at 1, namely, the set of integers. Two other closed balls of radius 1 are "centered" at 1/3 and 2/3, and all three closed balls of radius 1 form a closed ball of radius 3, <math>\{x| \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} . \, x = 1 + {n\over 3} \},</math> which is one out of three closed balls forming a closed ball of radius 9, and so on.''

#*: 3. In his recent book Professor Hensel has developed a theory of logarithms of the rational '''''p''-adic numbers''', and from this he has shown how all such numbers can be written in the form <math>p^\alpha \omega^\beta e^\gamma</math>.

#*: '''''p''-Adic numbers''' were introduced in mathematics by K. Hensel, and this invention led to substantial developments in number theory, where '''''p''-adic numbers''' are now as natural as ordinary real numbers.{{...}}Bleher noticed in [19] that the set of purely fractional '''''p''-adic numbers''' is an example of hierarchical lattice.

#*: <math>\Q_p</math> is called the '''''p-adic number''' field'', and its elements are called '''''p-adic numbers'''''. In this section we introduce the '''''p''-adic number''' fields, which are very important objects in number theory.
#*: The '''''p''-adic numbers''' were originally introduced by {{w|Kurt Hensel|Hensel}} around 1900.

====Usage notes====
* An expanded, constructive definition:
** For given <math>p</math>, the [[natural numbers]] are exactly those expressible as some ''finite'' sum <math>\textstyle\sum_{k=0}^n a_k p^k</math>, where each <math>a_k</math> is an integer: <math>0\le a_k<p</math> and <math>n\ge 0</math>. (To this extent, <math>p</math> acts exactly like a [[base]]).
** The slightly more general sum <math>\textstyle\sum_{k=N}^n a_k p^k</math> (where <math>N</math> can be negative) expresses a class of [[fraction]]s: natural numbers divided by a power of <math>p</math>.
** Much more expressiveness (to encompass all of <math>\Q</math>) results from permitting ''infinite'' sums: <math>\textstyle\sum_{k=N}^\infty a_k p^k</math>.
*** The [[p-adic ultrametric|''p''-adic ultrametric]] and the limitation on coefficients together ensure convergence, meaning that infinite sums can be manipulated to produce valid results that at times seem paradoxical. (For example, a sum with positive coefficients can represent a negative rational number. In fact, the concept {{m|en|negative}} has limited meaning for ''p''-adic numbers; it is best simply interpreted as {{m|en|additive inverse}}.)
** Forming the [[completion]] of <math>\Q</math> with respect to the ultrametric means augmenting it with the [[limit point]]s of ''all'' such infinite sums.
* The augmented set is denoted <math>\Q_p</math>.
* The construction works generally (for any integer <math>p>1</math>), but it is only for [[prime]] <math>p</math> that it becomes of significant mathematical interest.
** For <math>p</math> the power of some prime number, <math>\Q_p</math> is still a field. For other composite <math>p</math>, <math>\Q_p</math> is a [[ring]], but not a field.
* <math>\Q_p</math> is not the same as <math>\R</math>.
** For example, <math>\sqrt{p}\notin\Q_p</math> for any <math>p</math>, and, for some values of <math>p</math>, <math>\sqrt{-1}\in\Q_p</math>.
