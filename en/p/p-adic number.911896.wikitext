# {{mathematics}} An element of a [[completion]] of the field of [[rational number]]s which has a [[p-adic ultrametric|''p''-adic ultrametric]] as its [[metric]].<ref>'''2008''', Jacqui Ramagge, [http://www.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@inf/@math/documents/web/uow061321.pdf Unreal numbers: The story of ''p''-adic numbers]</ref>

#*: More formally, for a given prime ''p'', the field '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of ''p''-adic numbers is a completion of the rational numbers. The field '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> is also given a topology derived from a metric, which is itself derived from an alternative valuation on the rational numbers. This metric space is complete in the sense that every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>. This is what allows the development of calculus on '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, and it is the interaction of this analytic and algebraic structure which gives the ''p''-adic number systems their power and utility.
#: The expansion (21)2121<sub>''p''</sub> is equal to the rational <b>''p''-adic number</b> <math>{2 p + 1 \over p^2 - 1}</math>.
