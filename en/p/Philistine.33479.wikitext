===Alternative spellings===
* [[philistine]]

===Etymology===
From {{LL.}} {{term|Philistinus|lang=la}}, from Late {{etyl|grc|en}} {{term|Φυλιστῖνοι|tr=Phulistinoi|lang=grc|sc=polytonic}} from {{etyl|he|en}} {{term|פלשתים|tr=P'lishtim|lang=he|sc=Hebr}} from {{term|פלשת||Philistia|tr=P'leshet|lang=he|sc=Hebr}} {{rfscript|Hebrew|Could we get some vowel marks?}}.

The sense relating to lack of education and culture was introduced to English by Thomas Carlyle and greatly popularised by Matthew Arnold. It is derived from German student use of the term {{term|Philister||lang=de}} to refer to the burghers of the town. This apparently derived from the use of the biblical text "the Philistines be upon you, Samson" in a memorial service for a Jena university student who died as the result of a town vs. gown dispute in 1693.
