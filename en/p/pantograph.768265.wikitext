* {{a|UK}} {{IPA|/ˈpænt.ə.gɹæf/}}, {{SAMPA|/"p{nt.@.gr{f/}}

===Etymology 1===
[[Image:Pantograph (cropped).jpg|thumb|A '''pantograph''' (etymology 1)]]
From {{Gr.}} roots {{term|sc=Grek|παντ-||all, every}} and {{term|sc=Grek|γραφ||to write}} from their original use for copying writing

====Noun====
{{en-noun}}

# A mechanical [[linkage]] connected in a special manner based on [[parallelogram]]s so that they move in a fixed relationship to each other.  Originally used to copy drawings or writing by [[tracing]] with a pointer at one location on the pantograph causing a pen or pencil at another point to make the same pattern, possibly [[enlarged]] or [[shrunk]].
# A [[screen]] [[pattern]] printed on a document as a security feature.  Typically a line screen, consisting of parallel lines, is varied within the text zones by changing the line width and screen frequency in a manner that presents a uniform [[tone]] to the eye (a constant toning density). Upon copying, the greater frequency, smaller structure within the text zones coalesces into lines, relative to the background, thus bringing the text to foreground and rendering it easily visible.
