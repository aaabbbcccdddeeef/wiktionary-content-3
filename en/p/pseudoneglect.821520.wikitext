Pseudoneglect refers to the mild deficit in spatial attention displayed by neurologically normal individuals.  The perceptual asymmetries of pseudoneglect tend to favour the left side of space, making leftward errors in line bisections as well as in the judgment of brightness, numerosity, and size quite common.  This phenomenon is most often attributed to a disproportionate activation of the right hemisphere which biases attention to the left hemispace, while slightly neglecting the right.
