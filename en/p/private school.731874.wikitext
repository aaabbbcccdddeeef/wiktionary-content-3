#*: '''Private schools''' and educational success Australia has long had three substantially separate streams of secondary education: government schools, Catholic schools, and a diverse collection of '''private schools''' not affiliated with the Catholic Church. Of the non-Catholic '''private schools''', about two thirds are associated with Protestant churches - although only a minority have a strong religious character - and another third are non-denominational.
