#* '''1797''', John Norden quoted in ''Topographia Hibernica'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=5mEPAAAAYAAJ&hl=en&pg=PA44 pages 44–45]:
#*: The table is projected upon a '''parallelogramme''', the ſides whereof are divided into miles ; ſo that tough the ſides look like meridians and parallels, yet they are not ſo, but a meer ſcale, from which therefore are drawn croſs the table ſmall black equidiſtant lines, looking alſo like to parallels and meridians, but ſerving only for the readier taking of the diſtances, the diviſions of theſe lines from eaſt to weſt ſtanding for five, from north to ſouth for four miles.
