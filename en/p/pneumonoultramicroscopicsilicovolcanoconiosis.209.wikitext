{{rel-top|Usage notes}}
* The Oxford English Dictionary lists ''pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'' as “a factitious word alleged to mean ‘a lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine silica dust usually found in volcanos’ but occurring chiefly as an instance of a very long word”.<ref name="OED-pronstress&usage"/>

* This word was invented purely to be a contender for the title of the longest word in the English language, comprising forty-five letters. The word is not in official medical usage, and textbooks refer to this disease as [[pneumonoconiosis]], [[pneumoconiosis]], or [[silicosis]].
