'''Passive armour''' describes shielding that is chemically inert and doesn't require electricity or active sensors to operate.  Any vehicle with a skin designed to protect it from external attack is considered to have passive armor.

It is usually made of metal, ceramic, or in some cases, composites of different materials.
