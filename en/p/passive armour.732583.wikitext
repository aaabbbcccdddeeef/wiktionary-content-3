'''Passive armour''' is a modern military term which describes shielding that is chemically inert (unlike [[reactive armour]]) and does not require electricity or active sensors to operate. Any vehicle with a skin designed to protect it from attack is considered to have passive armor.

It is usually made of metal, ceramic, or in some cases, [[composite material]]s.
