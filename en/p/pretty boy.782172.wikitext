==English==
A male, although not necessarily young, who is aware of and enjoys his attractive qualities and grooms himself to maintain such while paying close attention to face, physical health/fitness and apparel.

Most "pretty boys" possess a high level of self-confidence which borderlines cockiness and arrogance as well as a high sense of self-awareness most consider to be vanity.

While they tend to enjoy making people smile, spending time in front of the mirror and complimenting themselves, most do not like to be called "pretty boy" but, instead, well-groomed or well-maintenanced because the term, used as slang, has also been referenced to homosexuality.
