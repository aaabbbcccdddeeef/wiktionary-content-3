# {{alternative spelling of|pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis}}
#* '''1953''': Charlton Grant Laird, ''Stability of Shortenings in Cereal and Baked Products'', [http://www.google.co.uk/books?id=vooaAAAAIAAJ&q=pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis&dq=pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis&pgis=1 p97]
#*: Thus, if you discover a spruce and your name is Engelmann, the tree becomes ''Picea engelmanni'', which is only ''Engelmannâ€™s spruce'' in Latin; if you discover a nonmetallic element and name it ''iodine'', you have only called it ''looking like a violet'', by giving it a Greek name for the color of its vapor; if you suffer from '''''pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis''''', you may be fatally ill, but your disease is being described in a series of classical syllables.
