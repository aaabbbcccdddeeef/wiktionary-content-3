'''Punding''' is [[human]] activity characterized by compulsive fascination with and performance of repetitive, mechanical tasks, such as assembling and disassembling, collecting, or sorting household objects. For example, punding may consist of activities such as:
* collecting [[pebble]]s and lining them up as perfectly as possible, 
* disassembling [[doorknob|doorknobs]] and putting them back together again, or
* adding or removing spaces in a [[Wikipedia]] article in such a way that the appearance of the article is affected only imperceptably or not at all. 

People engaging in punding find engaging in such activities comforting, even when it serves no purpose, and generally find it very frustrating to be diverted from them.

Tendencies towards punding are believed to be related to [[dopamine]] deficiency. It is commonly associated with [[Parkinson's disease]] and the use of [[methamphetamine]], which increases dopamine release and blocks its uptake.
