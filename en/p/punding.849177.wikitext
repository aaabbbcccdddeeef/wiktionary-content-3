'''Punding''' is [[human]] activity characterized by compulsive fascination with and performance of repetitive, mechanical tasks, such as assembling and disassembling, collecting, or sorting household objects. For example, punding may consist of activities such as:
* collecting [[pebble]]s and lining them up as perfectly as possible, 
* disassembling [[doorknob|doorknobs]] and putting them back together again, 

People engaging in punding find engaging in such activities comforting, even when it serves no purpose, and generally find it very frustrating to be diverted from them.

Tendencies towards punding are believed to be related to [[dopamine]] deficiency. It is commonly associated with [[Parkinson's disease]] and the use of [[methamphetamine]] (in which context it is known as ''tweaking''), which increases dopamine release and blocks its uptake.

Punding is the result of dopamine overactivity, rather than dopamine hypoactivity. In Parkinson's Disease it clearly results from the increase of the dopaminergic drug dose and it can be cured by lowering the dose, or adding (atypical) [[antipsychotic|antipsychotics]], which act by counteracting the effect of dopamine.
