# {{plural of|postulatum}}
#* '''1798''': the [[w:Thomas Robert Malthus|Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus FRS]], ''[[w:An Essay on the Principle of Population|An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', chapter 1
#*: I think I may fairly make two '''postulata'''. First, That food is necessary to the existence of man. Secondly, That the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state. These two laws, ever since we have had any knowledge of mankind, appear to have been fixed laws of our nature, and, as we have not hitherto seen any alteration in them, we have no right to conclude that they will ever cease to be what they now are, without an immediate act of power in that Being who first arranged the system of the universe, and for the advantage of his creatures, still executes, according to fixed laws, all its various operations. […] Assuming then my '''postulata''' as granted, I say, that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man. Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio.
