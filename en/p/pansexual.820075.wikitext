====Usage notes====
* Some people<!--, especially [[transgender]] and [[non-binary]] people and people who are [[attract]]ed to them,--> prefer this term to ''[[bisexual]]'' because of its acknowledgement of more than two genders.<ref>Nancy L. Fischer, Steven Seidman, ''Introducing the New Sexuality Studies'' (2016, ISBN 1317449185), page 219</ref><ref>Laura Erickson-Schroth, ''Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community'' (2014, ISBN 0199325367)</ref> Some other people dislike this term, either because they feel there ''are'' only two genders or they feel ''bisexual'' includes more than two genders,<ref>Lani Ka’ahumanu, ‎ Loraine Hutchins, ''Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out'' (2015, ISBN 1626011982)</ref> or they dislike the [[polysemy]] of ''pansexual''. Similar arguments are made about the less common term {{m|en|omnisexual}}.
