====Derived terms====

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# Someone who is attracted to all types of people regardless of [[gender]], [[gender identity]], or [[sexual orientation]].

====Usage notes====
* Both {{m|en||pansexual}} and {{m|en|omnisexual}} are potentially controversial terms, in that they denote sexuality beyond what is communicated by {{m|en|bisexual}}. To audiences who think of gender as only "male" or "female", the terms may logically equate beyond "all gender identities" to "everyone and everything", including [[zoophilia]]. Even disregarding zoophilia, some people believe anything beyond {{m|en||bisexual}} redundant, as {{m|en||bisexual}} may already logically include everyone.
* Furthermore, some people translate {{m|en|pan-}} and {{m|en|omni-}} differently, leading to arguments that one term means "many" and the other means "all", which may lead to claims that one is proper (not sexually exclusive to any human gender identity) and the other is improper and potentially insinuative of zoophilia.
