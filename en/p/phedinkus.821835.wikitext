The term may be analyzed as *''phe-'' + {{term|dinkus||contrivance (slang)|lang=en}}, where the prefix is an optional consonant /f/, with the stressless vowel added in the same way as other mutually [[w:apophony|apophonic]] prefixes (when the consonant changes, the vowel changes accordingly) such as ''pi-'' ({{term|pizazz|lang=en}})), ''she-'' ({{term|shebang|lang=en}})), etc.<ref>“The Iconicity of Consonant Alternation”, Roger W.

#* '''1937,''' (date of collection) {{w|Damon Runyon}}, “Tobias the Terrible”, collected in ''More than Somewhat:''
#*:If I have all the tears that are shed on Broadway by guys in love, I will have enough salt water to start an opposition ocean to the Atlantic and Pacific, with enough left over to run the Great Salt Lake out of business. But I wish to say I never shed any of these tears personally, because I am never in love, and furthermore, barring a bad break, I never expect to be in love, for the way I look at it love is strictly the old '''phedinkus''', and I tell the little guy as much.
