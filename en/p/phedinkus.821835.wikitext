===Etymology===
Coined 1935, by {{w|Damon Runyon}}.<ref>''The Routledge dictionary of modern American slang and unconventional English,'' by Tom Dalzell, Eric Partridge, 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5F-YNZRv-VMC&pg=PA742&dq=phedinkus p. 742]</ref>

Phonology pseudo-Greek<ref>''I break my word,'' [[w:Ivor Brown|Ivor John Carnegie Brown]], 1951, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CDJKAAAAMAAJ&dq=phedinkus p. 94], “Damon Runyon’s Broadway argot included ‘the old '''phedinkus'''’, which has a Grecian savour.”</ref> – note the ''ph''. The term may be analyzed as *''phe-'' + {{m|en|dinkus||contrivance (slang)}}, where the prefix is an optional consonant /f/, with the stressless vowel added in the same way as other mutually [[w:apophony|apophonic]] prefixes (when the consonant changes, the vowel changes accordingly) such as ''pi-'' ({{m|en|pizazz}}), ''she-'' ({{m|en|shebang}}), etc.<ref>“The Iconicity of Consonant Alternation”, Roger W. Wescott, in ''Functional approaches to language, culture, and cognition: papers in honor of [[w:Sydney Lamb|Sydney M. Lamb]],'' (2000), editors David G. Lockwood, Peter Howard Fries, James E.

#* '''1935,''' {{w|Damon Runyon}}, “Tobias the Terrible”, collected in ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=F-1LAAAAIAAJ&dq=phedinkus Money from home],'' Frederick A. Stokes company:
#*: If I have all the tears that are shed on Broadway by guys in love, I will have enough salt water to start an opposition ocean to the Atlantic and Pacific, with enough left over to run the Great Salt Lake out of business. But I wish to say I never shed any of these tears personally, because I am never in love, and furthermore, barring a bad break, I never expect to be in love, for the way I look at it love is strictly the old '''phedinkus''', and I tell the little guy as much.
#* '''1994,''' {{w|Gus Lee}}, ''China boy: a novel:''
#*: Like yur Uncle Shen, or whatsis '''phedinkus''' name. Yur fightin a big street lummox who kicks.

====Usage notes====
Very rarely used – coined by Runyon decades ago and has not entered common usage, with only very rare usage by other authors; incomprehensible without context or quotation.<ref>''Guys and Dolls and Other Writings,'' Damon Runyon, introduction by {{w|Pete Hamill}}, [http://books.google.com/books?ei=WK3PTbq3G4_KvQOjvtWVCg&ct=result&id=PCkgAQAAIAAJ&dq=phedinkus&q=%22nobody+alive%22#search_anchor p. viii]
“Nobody alive knows what a ‘'''phedinkus'''’ is, and Runyon’s stories are sprinkled with other words whose meanings have vanished into air. But their meanings can almost alway be deciphered from context.”</ref>
