# {{grammar}} '''Past tense''' is the form of language used to refer to an [[event]], [[transaction]], or [[occurrence]] that did happen or has happened, or an object that existed, at a point in time before now. Compare with [[present tense]], which refers to an event, transaction or occurrence which is happening now (or at the [[present]] time), or an object that currently exists; or with [[future tense]], which refers to an event, transaction or [[occurrence]] that has not yet happened, is expected to happen in the [[future]], or might never happen.
