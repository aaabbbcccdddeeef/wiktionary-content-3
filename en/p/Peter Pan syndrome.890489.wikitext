====Usage notes====
*Popularized by Dr. Dan Kiley, in ''The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up'' (1983), but earlier usages, with varied senses, exist.  Examples:

**:PSYCHOTIC CHILDREN: In the psychotic group, there appears what might be called a "'''Peter Pan syndrome'''": mistrust of others, grasp of immediate pleasure, retreat from time, refusal to consider entry into the world of adult plans and responsibilities, refusal to "grow up," or to die—all of these would seem to define one who is, indeed, an inhabitant of a Never-Never-Land.
