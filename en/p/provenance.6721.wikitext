====Usage notes====
* The term [[provenience]] in archaeology has largely replaced ''provenance'' because ''provenience'' is restricted to [[in situ]] location at the date of archaeological discovery rather than the "origin-to-present" [[chain of custody]] details of proper ''provenance'' as is customarily used by historians, museums, and commercial entities.
