===Verb===

# {{idiom}} to become mentally [[focused]] after a period on being unfocused.
#* {{rfdate}} E. M. Forster, ''Howards End''
#*: "Damn, damn, damnation!" he murmured, together with such other words as he had learnt from older men. Then he raised his hand to his forehead and said, "Oh, damn it all--" which meant something different. He '''pulled himself together'''. He drank a little tea, black and silent, that still survived upon an upper shelf. He swallowed some dusty crumbs of cake. Then he went back to the sitting-room, settled himself anew, and began to read a volume of Ruskin.
