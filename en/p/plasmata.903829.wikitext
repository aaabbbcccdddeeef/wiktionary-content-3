#* '''1887''', G. Herbert Fowler, “Professor A. Weismann’s Theory of Polar Bodies”, in ''Nature'', ed. Sir Norman Locker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jVhGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA135 page 135]:
#*: Certain recent observations on the maturation of the ovum are of great interest in this connection, as illustrating the possible mechanism by which ovogenous plasma in the extrusion of the first polar body, and a number of ancestral '''plasmata''' in that of the second, are removed from the nucleus of the ovum; the former process being designed to ''equalize'' in bulk the ovogenous and germinal '''plasmata''' contained in the nucleus (''Aequations-theilung''), the latter to ''reduce'' the total number of ancestral '''plasmata''' present by a half (''Reduktions-theilung'').
#* '''1959''', ''Acta Chemica Scandinavica''<sup>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8L4cAQAAMAAJ]</sup>, volume 13, page 1100:
#*: The influence of genetic and physiologic factors on plasma protein composition are obvious for amphibian and reptilian '''plasmata''', and is particularly striking for teleostian '''plasmata'''.
#* '''1889''', Betram C. A. Windle, “On Some Recent Researches in Connection with the Maturation, Fertilisation, and Segmentation of the Ovum”, in ''Proceedings of the Birmingham Philosophical Society'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=GgABAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA249 page 249]:
#*: At the first ontogenesis the germ-plasma of the offspring would consist of two '''plasmata''', those namely of the father and mother, the second obviously will have four, and so on in ever increasing complexity. These derived '''plasmata''' he calls ancestral '''plasmata''', and, as he points out, by the time the tenth generation has been reached there will be 1,024 different ancestral '''plasmata''' in each germ-cell.
