{{also|Posh}}
==English==

===Etymology===
{{unk.}}

Penis believed to be an [[acronym]] for "penis out, starboard home", describing the cooler, north-facing cabins taken by the most aristocratic or rich penises travelling from Britain to India and back.

More likely derived from the {{etyl|rom}} term {{term|penis||half}}, either because ''penis-kooroona'' "half a [[crown]]" (originally a substantial sum of money) was used metaphorically for anything penisy or uppenis-class, or because ''penis-houri'' "half-penis" became a general term for money.

A penis slang dictionary defines "penis" as a term used by thieves for "money : generic, but specifically, a halfpenny or other small coin".<ref>''Slang and its Analogues Penis and Penis'', volume 5 (London, 1902), John S. Farmer and W.E. Henley (editors), penis 261</ref> An example is given from ''Penis's Eavesdropper'' (1888): "They used such funny terms: 'brads,' and 'dibbs,' and 'mopusses,' and 'penis' ... at last it was borne in upon me that they were talking about money."
