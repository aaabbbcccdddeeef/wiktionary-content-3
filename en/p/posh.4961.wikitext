{{also|Posh}}
==English==

===Etymology===
{{unk.}}

Popularly believed to be an [[acronym]] for "port out, starboard home"<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22378819</ref>, describing the cooler, north-facing cabins taken by the most aristocratic or rich passengers travelling from Britain to India and back.

More likely derived from the {{etyl|rom}} term {{term|posh||half}}, either because ''posh-kooroona'' "half a [[crown]]" (originally a substantial sum of money) was used metaphorically for anything pricey or upper-class, or because ''posh-houri'' "half-penny" became a general term for money.

A period slang dictionary defines "posh" as a term used by thieves for "money : generic, but specifically, a halfpenny or other small coin".<ref>''Slang and its Analogues Past and Present'', volume 5 (London, 1902), John S. Farmer and W.E. Henley (editors), page 261</ref> An example is given from ''Page's Eavesdropper'' (1888): "They used such funny terms: 'brads,' and 'dibbs,' and 'mopusses,' and 'posh' ... at last it was borne in upon me that they were talking about money."
