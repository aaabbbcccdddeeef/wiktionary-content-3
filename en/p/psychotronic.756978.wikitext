#* '''1995''', Owen Matthews, [http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/report-soviets-used-top-secret-psychotronic-weapons/337288.html ''Report: Soviets Used Top-Secret '''Psychotronic''' Weapons''], [[w:themoscowtimes.com|TheMoscowTimes.com]]
#*:"Reports have emerged of a top secret program of "'''psychotronic'''" brainwashing techniques developed by the KGB and the Ministry of Defense in the 1970s to turn soldiers into fearless, unquestioning fighting machines and enemies into lethargic vegetables. The techniques, which include debilitating high frequency radio waves, hypnotic computer-scrambled sounds and mind-bending electromagnetic fields, as well as an ultrasound gun capable of killing a cat at fifty meters.."

#*:"In the original bill a ban was sought on ‘exotic weapons’ including electronic, '''psychotronic''' or information weapons, chemtrails, particle beams, plasmas, electromagnetic radiation, extremely low frequency (ELF) or ultra low frequency (ULF) energy radiation, or mind control technologies. [..] There is also a plan for ‘'''psychotronic''' weapons’ – apparently the projection of consciousness to other locations – and another to use holographic projection to disseminate propaganda and misinformation. [..] Politicians, scientists and neurologists, neuroscientists, physicists and the legal profession should, without further delay, demand public debate on the existence and deployment of '''psychotronic''' technology; and for the declassification of information about such devices which abuse helpless people, and threaten democratic freedom. [..] The medical profession should be helped to recognise the symptoms of mindcontrol and '''psychotronic''' abuse, and intelligence about their deployment should be declassified so that this abuse can be seen to be what it is, and not interpreted automatically as an indication of mental illness."

#*:"A proposal made in 2001 by Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) to ban "'''psychotronic''' weapons" (another common term for mind-control technology) was hailed by TIs as a great step forward. [..] The main display, set in front of the speaker's lectern has a more extended message: HELP STOP HI-TECH ASSAULT '''PSYCHOTRONIC''' TORTURE."

#*:"Military strategist Timothy Thomas examined these implications in his paper ‘The Mind Has No Firewall’ in which he states that ‘We are on the threshold of an era in which these data processors of the human body may be manipulated or debilitated. Examples of unplanned attacks on the body’s data–processing capability are well–documented’. He references a Russian military article on the same subject which declared that “‘humanity stands on the brink of a '''psychotronic''' war’ with the mind and body as the focus” [..] Documented and declassified evidence shows that what may have begun as a program in standardized propaganda and psychological warfare has now developed into research on wireless information targeting and ‘psychocivilized’ control practices. To this effect the term ‘psycho–terrorism’ was coined by Anisimov of the Moscow Anti–'''Psychotronic''' Center and Anisimov admits to testing such devices as are said to ‘take away a part of the information which is stored in a man’s brain."

#*:"The Americans as well as the Russians have been looking into '''psychotronic''' weapons for more than 15 years. You can find [http://www.angelfire.com/az3/newzone/mku.html ample references] to the subject on the Internet, including a [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/970707/archive_007360.htm feature published by U.S. News and World Report] in 1997 and a [http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/parameters/Articles/98spring/thomas.htm report written for a U.S. Army publication in 1998]. Such weapons purport to take advantage of the effect that pulsed microwaves can have on brain activity. Some researchers have reported an effect known as microwave hearing, in which a directed beam of radiation produces a sensation of buzzing, clicking or hissing in the head."

#*:"The development of weaponry based on new physics principles – direct-energy weapons, geophysical weapons, wave-energy weapons, genetic weapons, '''psychotronic''' weapons, and so on – is part of the state arms procurement program until 2020,” Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov reported to President-in-waiting Vladimir Putin during their latest meeting. Some media focused on “'''psychotronic'''” weapons – wonder devices that use energy waves to control enemy behavior, effectively turning him into a “zombie.” Several papers went on to speculate that these would be used internally against political “dissidents.” While rumors of Soviet, then Russian '''psychotronic''' weapons have surfaced repeatedly for decades, not one has been able to produce a working psychotronic gun, or even explain what mystery rays would allow its owner to control other people’s brains."

#*:"The development of weaponry based on new physics principles; direct-energy weapons, geophysical weapons, wave-energy weapons, genetic weapons, '''psychotronic''' weapons, etc., is part of the state arms procurement program for 2011-2020,”[http://rt.com/news/weapons-future-zombie-media-486/ Serdyukov said] at a meeting with the then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, cited RIA Novosti. [..] Some of the programs in '''psychotronic''' research – even those launched decades ago – have not been officially published."
