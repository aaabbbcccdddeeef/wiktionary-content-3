==English==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|la}} {{term|petra|lang=la||stone, rock}}, from {{etyl|grc}} {{term|sc=polytonic|πέτρα|tr=pétra|lang=grc||stone, rock}}.  Its use as an abbreviation for ''petroleum'' is awkward and misleading.  When referring to products associated with oil, the prefix should be ''oleo-'' (see {{term|oil}}), as in ''oleomargarine'', a butter substitute derived from vegetable oils.

===Prefix===

# of or pertaining to stone
