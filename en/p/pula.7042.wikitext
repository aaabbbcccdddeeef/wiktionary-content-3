==Romanian==
===Etymology===
Perhaps from Latin word ''[[ampulla]]'', something swollen (e.g. a bottle or phial)]; some Romanian dictionaries claim it is from the Latin word ''[[pullus]]'', chicken; another theory is that it is a [[Dacian]] word:
<!--
#''Romanian dictionaries don't show the word "pula" or, if this word is presented, its etymology is shown to be from the Latin word "pullus" (chicken).''
#''A theory says that "pula" is a Dacian word and it has older roots than Latin language:''-->
*pesnis - pennis - penis (Latin)
*pesnis - pennis - pelnis - pellis - pula (Romanian; unconvincing theory)
