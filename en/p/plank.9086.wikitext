===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|plank}}, {{m|enm|planke}}, from {{etyl|xno|en}} {{m|fro|planke}}, {{etyl|ONF.|en}} {{m|fro|planque}} (compare French {{m|fr|planche}}, from Old French {{m|fro|planche}}), from {{etyl|LL.|en}} {{m|la|planca}}, probably from {{m|la|*palanca}} (ultimately from {{etyl|la|en}} {{m|la|phalanga}}) possibly through the influence of {{m|la|planus}}. Compare also the doublet {{m|en|planch}}, borrowed later from Middle French.
