===Etymology===
From {{etyl|xno|en}} {{term|planke|lang=fro}}, {{etyl|ONF.|en}} {{term|planque|lang=fro}} (compare French {{term|planche|lang=fr}}, from Old French {{term|planche|lang=fro}}), from {{etyl|LL.|en}} {{term|planca|lang=la}}, probably from {{term/t|la|*palanca}} (ultimately from {{etyl|la|en}} {{term|phalanga|lang=la}}) possibly through the influence of {{term|planus|lang=la}}. Cf. also the doublet {{term|planch}}, borrowed later from Middle French.
