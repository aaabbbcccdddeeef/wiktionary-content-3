===Alternative forms===
* [[Palare]]

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|it|en}} {{term|parlare||to talk|lang=it}}. The loss of the first ''r'' and the changing vowel quality of the non-stressed vowels is due to the non-rhotic UK accent which reinterpreted the phonemes. The adoption of the infinitive form means that the word probably came via a Romance-based creole or pidgin like {{etyl|pml|-}}.

===Proper noun===
