===Etymology 1===
Borrowed from {{der|en|grc|πρόνοιᾰ||foreknowledge, foresight; providence; form of land grant}}, from {{m|grc|πρόνοος||careful, prudent}} +‎ {{m|grc|-ῐᾰ||''suffix forming nouns''}}. {{lang|grc|πρόνοος}} is derived from {{m|grc|προ-||''prefix indicating a coming forth''}} + {{m|grc|νόος||the mind; act of the mind}}. The English word is cognate with {{cog|la|pronoea||providence}}.<ref>{{R:OED Online|part of speech=''n.{{sup|1}}''|noformat=yes|id=265174|date=June 2007}}</ref>

The plural form ''pronoiae'' is probably a modification of {{der|en|la|pronoeae}}, while ''pronoiai'' is from {{der|en|grc|πρόνοιαι}}.

It is the delusion that others think well of one. Actions and the products of one's efforts are thought to be well received and praised by others. Mere acquaintances are thought to be close friends; politeness and the exchange of pleasantries are taken as expressions of deep attachment and the promise of future support. '''Pronoia''' appears to be rooted in the social complexity and cultural ambiguity of our lives: we have become increasingly dependent on the opinions of others based on uncertain criteria.}}
