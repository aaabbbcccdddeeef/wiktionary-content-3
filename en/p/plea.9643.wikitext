===Noun===
'''plea'''

# ([[Law]]) That which is alleged by a party in support of his cause; in a stricter sense, an allegation of [[fact]] in a [[cause]], as distinguished from a [[demurrer]]; in a still more limited sense, and in modern practice, the defendant's answer to the [[plaintiff]]'s declaration and [[demand]]. That which the plaintiff alleges in his declaration is answered and repelled or justified by the [[defendant]]'s plea. In chancery practice, a plea is a special answer showing or relying upon one or more things as a cause why the suit should be either dismissed, delayed, or barred. In criminal practice, the plea is the defendant's formal answer to the indictment or information presented against  him / her.
# (Law) A cause in court; a [[lawsuit]]; as, the Court of Common Pleas. See under [[Common]].
