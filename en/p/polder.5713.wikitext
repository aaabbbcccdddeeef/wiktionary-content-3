===Etymology===
From {{etyl|nl|en}}. The root is 'pol', which is the same as 'ball'. A 'pol' was a low artificial hill in a coastal marshland whereupon a farmhouse could be build. The original plural was probably 'poller', which became 'polder'. From the small hill the word eventually referred to the land around it. {{attention|nl}}
