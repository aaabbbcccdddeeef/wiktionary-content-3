Pusillanimity (from the ecclesiastical Latin pusillanimis, a translation of the Greek olugopsukhos), from pusillus ‘very small’ + animus ‘mind,’ + -ous) is the vice of being timid and cowardly, and thus not living up to one's full [[potential]]. It's antithesis is [[magnanimity]], as defined by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Nicomachean Ethics]].

As an adjective, the concept is expressed as "pusillanimous," i.e. "He is rather pusillanimous."
