#*: Although Supergirl fans will relish page 4, I believe the first panel of 5 says it all: after a full force ramming by SG, '''PG''' just casually tosses her into a wall. Now *that's* Power Girl.

#*: Actually, a point could be made that the animated Supergirl is much more like Power Girl than the pre Crisis Supergirl.
#*: For one thing she adopted the name Karen (Karen Starr was the name Kara Zor-L created), also she wears '''PG'''<nowiki/>'s costume colors and has a strong resentment toward's Clark's overprotectiveness. The only difference is that the animated SG has the Kara Zor-El personality more than she does Power Girl's.

#*: I kinda hate how they made Power Girl (Kara/SG pre-Crisis on World 2 or 3?) evil and a clone of SG. One of my fav comics growing up was Supes, and '''PG''' and I think Green Arrow going after Vandal Savage.
