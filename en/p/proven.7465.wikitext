{{also|provén|prøven}}
==English==

===Etymology===
From Scottish English, as past participle of {{m|en|preve}}, a {{etyl|enm|en}} variant of {{m|en|prove}}<ref name="ahd">{{R:American Heritage 2000|prove}}</ref><ref name="mw">{{R:Merriam Webster Online|prove}}</ref> – compare {{m|en|woven}} (from {{m|en|weave}}) and {{m|en|cloven}} (from {{m|en|cleave}}),<ref name="ahd" /> both of which feature ''-eve'' → ''-oven''. {{m|en||Preve}} died out in England, but survived in Scotland, where '''proven''' developed, initially in a legal context, as in “The jury ruled that the charges were not proven.”<ref name="ahd" /> See [[#Usage notes|usage notes]] for historical usage patterns.

Earlier, from {{etyl|LL.|en}} {{m|la|probō||test, try, examine, approve, show to be good or fit, prove|pos=verb}}, from {{m|la|probus||good, worthy, excellent}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*pro-bhwo-||being in front, prominent}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*pro-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*per-||toward}} + {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*bhu-||to be}}.

====Usage notes====
As the past participle of {{m|en|prove}}, '''proven''' is often discouraged, with {{m|en|proved}} preferred – “have proved” rather than “have proven”. However, they are both about equally common in everyday use in US English. Both are used and considered correct in UK English, but “have proved” is more common.<ref name=oed>{{R:Oxford Dictionaries Online|prove}}</ref><ref name="ahd"/><ref name="mw"/>

Historically, ''proved'' is the older form, while '''proven''' arose as a Scottish variant – see [[#Etymology|etymology]]. Used in legal writing from the mid-17th century, it entered literary usage more slowly, only becoming significant in the 19th century, with the poet {{w|Alfred, Lord Tennyson}} among the earliest frequent users (presumably for reasons of meter).<ref name="mw"/> In the 19th century, '''proven''' was widely discouraged, and remained significantly less common through the mid-20th century (''proved'' being used approximately four times as often); by the late 20th century it came to be used about equally often in US English.<ref name="mw"/>

As an attributive adjective, '''proven''' is much<ref name="mw"/><ref name=oed/> more commonly used,<ref name="ahd"/> and {{m|en|proved}} is widely considered an error – “a proven method”, not *“a proved method”.
