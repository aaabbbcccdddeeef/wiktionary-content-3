==Translingual==

===Etymology===
{{etyl|NL.|mul}} See ''[[poly-]]'', and ''[[Cystidea]]''.

===Proper noun===
{{mul-proper noun}}

# {{context|obsolete|zoology|lang=mul}} A division of ''{{taxlink|Gregarinia|order}}'' including those that have two or more internal divisions of the body.
# {{context|obsolete|zoology|lang=mul}} A [[species]] of large brown [[algae]], {{taxlink|Cystophora polycystidea|species}} found in Spencer Gulf, South Australia.

====Usage notes====
* Taxonomic revisions and the adoption of standardized suffixes for naming biological entities appear to have rendered the name of this "division" obsolete. The intended organism appears to be a [[parasitic]] [[amoeba]]-like [[protozoan]] in the subclass ''{{taxlink|Telosporea|subclass}}'' rather than the flatworm family ''{{taxlink|Polycystidae|family}}''.
