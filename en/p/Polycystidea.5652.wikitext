{{etyl|NL.|mul}} See ''[[poly-]]'', and ''[[Cystidea]]''.

{{mul-proper noun}}

# {{obsolete|zoology|lang=mul}} A division of [[Gregarinæ]] including those that have two or more internal divisions of the body.
# {{obsolete|zoology|lang=mul}} A [[species]] of large brown [[algae]], ''[[Cystophora]] polycystidea'' found in Spencer Gulf, South Australia.

====Usage notes====
* Taxonomic revisions and the adoption of standardized suffixes for naming biological entities appear to have rendered the name of this "division" obsolete. The intended organism appears to be a [[parasitic]] [[amoeba]]-like [[protozoan]] in the subclass [[Telosporea]] rather than the flatworm family [[polycystidae]]
