'''Piss-proud''' (as well as ''Morning Glory'') is a British [[idiom]], which means having a false erection or more generally  falsely proud. It refers to the common phenomenon of men waking up in the morning with an [[erection|erect penis]] (see nocturnal penile tumescence), often attributed to be the result of a full [[bladder]].<ref>See for example ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]].</ref> (In the [[US]] such an erection is colloquially referred to as [[morning wood]].)

The idiom also refers to the kind of empty pride a person (or a person's personified penis) might have in considering such erections, falsely, to be an indication of [[virility]], instead of the simple need to urinate ("[[piss]]").

The term is mentioned in Francis Grose’s ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'', (1785):

:“Piss-proud, having a false erection. That old fellow thought he had an erection, but his &mdash; was only piss-proud; said of any old fellow who marries a young wife”.
