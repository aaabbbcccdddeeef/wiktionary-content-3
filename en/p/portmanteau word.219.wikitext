==English==

===Etymology===
Coined by [[w:Lewis_Carroll|Lewis Carroll]] based on the concept of two words packed together, like a [[portmanteau]] (a travelling case having two halves joined by a hinge).

===Noun===
'''[[portmanteau]] [[word]]''' (''plural'' '''[[portmanteau words]]''')

# {{linguistics}}  A word formed which combines the meaning of two words (or, rarely, more than two words) by combining the words, usually, but not always, by adjoining the first part of one word and the last part of the other, the adjoining parts often having a common vowel; for example, ''[[smog]]'', formed from ''[[smoke]]'' and ''[[fog]]''.

====Synonyms====
* [[blend]], [[frankenword]], [[portmanteau]], [[amalgamation]]
<!--

====Quotations====
This is a bad example, as "multiculturalism" is not a portmanteau word as we have defined it above. - Paul G
#:* '''1995''' "[[Multiculturalism]]" is a [[portmanteau word]], containing in its [[definition]] and its [[resonance]] [[connotation]]s as many [[concept]]s as a suitcase does socks - Michael Cart, ''From Romance to Realism'', page 110.
