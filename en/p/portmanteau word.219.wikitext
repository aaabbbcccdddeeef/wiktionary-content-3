==English==

===Etymology===
Coined by [[w:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]] in 1872, based on the concept of two words packed together, like a [[portmanteau]] (a travelling case having two halves joined by a hinge).
: 'Well, “[[slithy]]” means “[[lithe]] and [[slimy]].” “Lithe” is the same as “active”. You see it’s like a '''[[portmanteau]]'''–there are two meanings packed up into one word.'
''[[s:Through The Looking Glass (And What Alice Found There)|Through The Looking Glass]]'' ([[s:Through the Looking Glass (And What Alice Found There)/Chapter VI|Chapter VI. Humpty Dumpty]])
