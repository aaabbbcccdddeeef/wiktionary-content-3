===Alternative forms===
* {{l|ga|baoghal}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|ga|sga|báegul||unguarded condition, danger, hazard, vulnerability; chance, opportunity (of taking by surprise, inflicting an injury); making a mistake in judgement, etc., liability arising from error (or negligence ?)}} (compare {{cog|gd|baoghal||weirdo; fool, idiot; harm, peril, crisis}}).

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|Munster}} {{IPA|ga|/bˠeːl̪ˠ/}}
* {{a|Connacht}} {{IPA|ga|/bˠiːlˠ/}}
* {{a|Ulster}} {{IPA|ga|/bˠiːlˠ/|/bˠɯːlˠ/|qual2=older}}

The genitive singular of this word is pronounced [bˠweːlʲ] in [[w|Munster]] and formerly [[w|County Kilkenny]], and not [bˠwiːlʲ] as wrongly suggested by the [[w|Caighdeán Oifigiúil]]'s reduced spelling ''baoil''. In [[wikipedia|Munster]] and formerly [[wikipedia|County Kilkenny]], ''ao'' [ɯː] before "broad" (non-palatal) consonants has become [eː], whereas ''ao'' [ɯː] before "slender" (palatal) consonants has become [iː]. Accordingly, in [[w|Munster]] and [[w|County Kilkenny]], ''ao'' [ɯː] became [eː] in both nom.sg. ''baoghal'' [bˠɯːɣˠəlˠ] (which became ''"buéghal"'' [bˠweːɣˠəlˠ]) and gen.sg. ''baoghail'' [[bˠɯːɣˠəlʲ] (which became ''"buéghail"'' [bˠweːɣˠəlʲ]) because ''ao'' [ɯː] preceded a "broad" (non-palatal) consonant, in this case ''gh'' [ɣˠ], which only later disappeared, reducing nom.sg. ''"buéghal"'' [bˠweːɣˠəlˠ] to ''"buél"'' [bˠweːlˠ], and gen.sg. ''"buéghail"'' [bˠweːɣˠəlʲ] to ''"buéil"'' [bˠweːlʲ]. Each dialect can derive its pronunciation by regular sound change from the Classical spelling ''baoghal/baoghail'' but not from the current [[w|Caighdeán Oifigiúil]] spelling ''baol/baoil''. For a similar pronunciation mismatch in the current [[w|Caighdeán Oifigiúil]], compare the reduced spelling of {{l|ga|saol}} from Classical {{l|ga|saoghal}}.
