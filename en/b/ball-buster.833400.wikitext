===Etymology===
{{unk|en}}. Surface analysis 
{{compound|en|ball|buster}}.

Unlikely derived from or akin to {{der|en|en|baleboste||mistress, lady of the house|nocat=1}}, in which case the synonyms may be secondary derivations. <ref>Jewish Language Review, Issue 7. Israel: Association for the Study of Jewish Languages, 1987.</ref> While the original significance of the first element remains unclear as a case of folk etymology, see also {{m|en|Beelzebub}} for connotations of the same supposed first element; {{m|en|bale}} for a similar word. Any deverbal formation conflated with [[back-breaking]] may have informed the native development. {{rfe|en}}

<!-- Cp. Gaulish [[ambaxtos]], En. [[Bess]]? Bastian "bat-man"? Cp. OHG bozen "to strike", German [[Amboss]] "anvil" < anabelzi, an(e)bōʒ, etc., MHG once "ambot", reportedly also of big women (''can this be confirmed?''). In case it named the Dominatrix of a Brothel, eventually, you need to take a leap of faith.

The yiddish word itself seems terribly erroded. !-->
