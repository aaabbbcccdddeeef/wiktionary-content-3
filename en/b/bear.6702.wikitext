===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|bere}}, from {{inh|en|ang|bera}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*berō}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*berô}} (compare {{cog|fy|bear}}, {{cog|nl|beer}}, {{cog|de|Bär}}, {{cog|da|bjørn}}).

{{rel-top|etymology notes}}
This is generally taken to be from {{der|en|ine-pro|*bʰer-|t=shining, brown}} (compare {{cog|xto||parno}}, {{cog|txb||perne|t=radiant, luminous}}, {{cog|lt|bė́ras|t=brown}}), related to {{m|en|brown}} and {{m|en|beaver}}.

The Germanic languages replaced the older name of the bear, {{m|ine-pro|*h₂ŕ̥tḱos}}, with the epithet "brown one", presumably due to taboo avoidance; compare {{cog|ru|медве́дь|t=bear|lit=honey-eater}}.

However, Ringe (2006:106) doubts the existence of a root *bʰer- meaning "brown" ("an actual PIE word of [the requisite] shape and meaning is not recoverable") and suggests that a derivation from {{der|en|ine-pro|*ǵʰwer-|t=wild animal}} "should therefore perhaps be preferred", implying a Germanic merger of ''*ǵʰw'' and ''*gʷʰ'' (''*gʷʰ'' may sometimes result in Germanic ''*b'', perhaps e.g. in {{m|gem-pro|*bidjaną}}, but it also seems to have given the ''g'' in {{m|en|gun}} and the ''w'' in {{m|en|warm}}<!--Note: there seem to be very few Germanic words coming from *gʷʰ.-->).

=====Usage notes=====
* The past participle of ''bear'' is usually ''borne'':
** ''He could not have '''borne''' that load.''
** ''She had '''borne''' five children.''
** ''This is not to be '''borne'''!''
* However, when ''bear'' is used in the [[passive voice]] to mean "to be given birth to" literally or figuratively (e.g. be [[create]]d, be the [[result]] of), the form used to form all tenses is ''born'':
** ''She '''was born''' on May 3.''
** ''Racism '''is''' usually '''born out of''' a real or feared loss of power to a minority or a real or feared decrease in relative prosperity compared to that of the minority.''
** '''''Born''' three years earlier, he was the eldest of his siblings.''
** "The idea to create [the Blue Ridge Parkway] '''was born''' in the travail of the Great Depression {{...}}." (Tim Pegram, ''The Blue Ridge Parkway by Foot: A Park Ranger's Memoir'', {{ISBN|0786431407}}, 2007, page 1)
* Both spellings have been used in the construction ''born(e) into the world/family'' and ''born(e) to someone'' (as a child). The ''borne'' spellings are more frequent in older and religious writings.
** ''He was '''born(e)''' to Mr. Smith.''
** ''She was '''born(e)''' into the most powerful family in the city.''
** "[M]y father was '''borne''' to a Swedish mother and a Norwegian father, both devout Lutherans." (David Ross, ''Good Morning Corfu: Living Abroad Against All Odds'', {{ISBN|1452450323}}, 2009)
* In some colloquial speech, {{m|en|beared}} can be found for both the simple past and the past participle, although it is usually considered nonstandard and avoided in writing. Similarly, {{m|en|bore}} may be extended to the past participle; the same provisos apply for this form.
