===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|bere}}, from {{inh|en|ang|bera}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*ber√¥}} (compare {{cog|fy|bear}}, {{cog|nl|beer}}, {{cog|de|B√§r}}, {{cog|da|bj√∏rn}}).

{{rel-top|etymology notes}}
This is generally taken to be from {{der|en|ine-pro|*b ∞er-|t=shining, brown}} (compare {{cog|xto||parno}}, {{cog|txb||perne|t=radiant, luminous}}, {{cog|lt|bƒóÃÅras|t=brown}}), related to {{m|en|brown}} and {{m|en|beaver}}.

The Germanic languages replaced the older name of the bear, {{m|ine-pro|*h‚ÇÇ≈ïÃ•t·∏±os|*rtko-}}, with the epithet "brown one", presumably due to taboo avoidance; compare {{cog|ru|–º–µ–¥–≤–µÃÅ–¥—å|t=bear|lit=honey-eater}}.

However, Ringe (2006:106) doubts the existence of a root *b ∞er- meaning "brown" ("an actual PIE word of [the requisite] shape and meaning is not recoverable") and suggests that a derivation from {{der|en|ine-pro|*«µ ∞wer-|t=wild animal}} "should therefore perhaps be preferred", implying a Germanic merger of ''*«µ ∞w'' and ''*g ∑ ∞'' (''*g ∑ ∞'' may sometimes result in Germanic ''*b'', perhaps e.g. in {{m|gem-pro|*bidjanƒÖ}}, but it also seems to have given the ''g'' in {{m|en|gun}} and the ''w'' in {{m|en|warm}}<!--Note: there seem to be very few Germanic words coming from *g ∑ ∞.-->).
