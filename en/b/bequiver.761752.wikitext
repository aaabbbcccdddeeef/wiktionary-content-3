Possible meaning = frighten, shaking of the body in fright, quiver about. 

It is not listed in any dictionary, though I have not checked the Oxford English dictionary.  The context is from pg 142 of:

Foundation and empire
Isaac Asimov
Publisher: New York : Ballantine Books, 1983, c1952.
ISBN: 0345317998

the context:

''"Yes?" The clown stirred uneasily. "That may be, my lady, but he has questioned me before, and his manner is of an abruptness and loudness that '''bequivers''' me. He is full of strange words, so that the answers to his questions could not worm out of my throat. Almost, I might believe the romancer who once played on my ignorance with a tale that, at such moments, the heart lodged in the windpipe and prevented speech."''

Another context gleened from casual writings on the internet is:

''Oh wait, I never wanted to '''bequiver''' internet geeks. Carry on, then.''

From etymology, combining the prefix "be" with quiver means, "quiver about"
