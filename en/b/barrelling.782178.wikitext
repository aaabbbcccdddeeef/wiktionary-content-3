# {{lb|en|material processing}} Occurs during [[forging]], when, due to [[friction]] between the work piece and the [[die]] and [[punch]], the work piece bulges at its centre int a in such a way to resemble a [[barrel]]. This leads to the central part of the work piece to come in contact with the sides of the [[die]] sooner than if there was no friction present, creating a much greater increase in the pressure required for the punch to finish the [[forging]].
