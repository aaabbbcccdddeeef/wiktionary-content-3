# A [[male]] partner in a non-marital romantic relationship.

# A [[male]] friend.

====Usage notes====
In contrast to its female equivalent, girlfriend, which is often used to describe a woman's close female friends, the term is not that often used in reference to non-romantic relationships. ''Boyfriend'' is a relatively modern term, and in the past has had implications of an illicit relationship (as sexual and romantic relationships outside marriage were generally frowned upon). It is now a generally accepted term and has no negative implications.

Use of ''boyfriend'' generally implies that the male is a [[boy]] or a [[young]] [[man]]. An [[old]]er man in a non-marital [[relationship]] and sometimes even a young man in a long-term relationship is more often described as a [[significant other]] or [[partner]].

Separating the word into its two components ''boy friend'' avoids the romantic implication nowadays, although ''[[boy friend]]'' used to mean the same as ''boyfriend'' does now. However, British and Australian men usually refer to a male friend as a [[mate]]. Similarly, Americans and Canadians use the term [[buddy]].
