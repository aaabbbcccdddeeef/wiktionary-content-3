* {{IPA|/ˈbɔɪ.ˌfrɛnd/|lang=en}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# A [[male]] partner in a romantic relationship.
# A [[male]] friend.

====Usage notes====
In contrast to its female equivalent, girlfriend, which is often used to describe a woman's close female friends, the term is not that often used in reference to non-romantic relationships. ''Boyfriend'' is a relatively modern term, and in the past has had implications of an illicit relationship (as sexual and romantic relationships outside marriage were generally frowned upon). It is now a generally accepted term and has no negative implications.

Use of ''boyfriend'' generally implies that the male is a [[boy]] or a [[young]] [[man]]. An [[old]]er man in a non-marital [[relationship]] and sometimes even a young man in a long-term relationship is more often described as a [[significant other]] or [[partner]].

Separating the word into its two components ''boy friend'' avoids the romantic implication nowadays, although ''boy friend'' used to mean the same as ''boyfriend'' does now. However, British and Australian men usually refer to a male friend as a [[mate]]. Similarly, Americans and Canadians use the term [[buddy]].
