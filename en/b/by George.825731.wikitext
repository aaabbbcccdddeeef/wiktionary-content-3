===Etymology===
{{rfe|is this from {{term|Saint George}}, is it a corruption of {{term|God}}, or is it after somebody else, like one of the kings of England named George?|lang=en}}

"By (God and Saint) George" is a old English oath invoked immediately before charging into battle as late as World War I. A version of the oath can be found in Shakespeare's "Henry V", written circa 1600 and set in 1415.

The oath is most memorably spoken by a gentleman in a scene from the musical comedy "My Fair Lady" to emphasize the heroine's metamorphasis from lower to upper class. The playwrite is parodying late Victorian fervor, often faux patriotic, not-atypical of the type employed by George Bernard Shaw in such works  as "Pygmalian", the Twentieth Century stage and screen version of which is the aforesaid "My Fair Lady".
