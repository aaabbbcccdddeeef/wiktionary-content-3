===Etymology===
{{rfe|is this from {{term|Saint George}}, is it a corruption of {{term|God}}, or is it after somebody else, like one of the kings of England named George?|lang=en}}

"By (Saint) George" is a old english phrase invoked before battle as late as World War I. The reference is a parody of late Victorian fervor, often faux patriotic, of the type employed by George Bernard Shaw in such works  as "Pygmalian", the Twentieth Century stage version of which is the Tony award, and later Motion Picture Academy award winning musical "My Fair Lady". (Not sure if the line is Shaw's or a Broadway re-write, which, if the case, is "spot on" just the same.)
