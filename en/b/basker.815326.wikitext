#*: We'd had our first encounter with a ''basking shark'', and, metaphorically at least, this gigantic, strange beast had me firmly in its jaws. Out of our wetsuits and back on dry land, we headed for the marine laboratories at Port Erin on the south of the island to meet biologist Jill Strawbridge. Coming face to face with a '''basker''' had whetted my appetite, and I was keen to get to the bottom of some of the mysteries surrounding Cetorhinus maximus.

#*: {{...}} they needed an animal that was content to ''bask'' in various different conditions. What they hadn't banked on was that their ideal '''basker''', would come equipped with a bad attitude and fearsome set of teeth: 'crocodiles are the perfect model organism for this study' explains Seebacher, because they are happy to ''bask'' both in and out of water.
# Any of various species of [[libellulid]] [[dragonfly]] of the genus {{taxlink|Urothemis|species}}, [[endemic]] to Africa and Asia.
