====Usage notes====
* The plural “brethren” (cf. “[[sistren]]”, “[[sistern]]”) is not used for biological brothers in contemporary English (although it was in older usage). It still finds use, however, in the meaning of “members of a religious order”. It is also sometimes used in other figurative senses, e.g. “adherents of the same religion”, “countrymen”, and the like.
