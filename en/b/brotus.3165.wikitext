===Etymology===
Mitford Mathews suggested in 1951 that the term derived from {{m|en||brot|scrap(s), small amount(s)}},<ref name="Cassidy">F. G. Cassidy, ''Etymology in Caribbean Creoles'', in ''Focus on the Caribbean'' (ISBN 9027248664), which quotes Mathew's ''Dictionary of Americanisms'' (1951)</ref> a northern England dialectal term ultimately derived from {{etyl|ang|-}} {{m|ang|brēotan}},<ref>''The English Dialect Dictionary'' (1898)</ref> but Frederic Cassidy notes that this has "no connection to the marketing context"<ref name="Cassidy"/> and Joey Lee Dillard finds the idea "unconvincing".<ref>Joey Lee Dillard, ''Toward a Social History of American English''</ref> Cassidy mentions that the term might be related to {{etyl|jam|-}} {{m|jam|braata||little extra given by a seller to a buyer}}, though he considers this "questionable" because "the stressed vowel is rather different [...] and the final ''-us'' of the American form would have to be accounted for"; the Jamaican term might derive from a {{etyl|es|-}} cognate of {{etyl|pt|-}} {{m|pt|barato||favour}}.<ref name="Cassidy"/>
