===Etymology===
Mitford Mathews suggested in 1951 that the term derived from {{m|en||brot|scrap(s), small amount(s)}},<ref name="Cassidy">F. G. Cassidy, ''Etymology in Caribbean Creoles'', in ''Focus on the Caribbean'' {{ISBN|9027248664}}, which quotes Mathew's ''Dictionary of Americanisms'' (1951)</ref> a northern England dialectal term ultimately derived from {{cog|ang|brēotan}},<ref>''The English Dialect Dictionary'' (1898)</ref> but Frederic Cassidy notes that this has "no connection to the marketing context"<ref name="Cassidy"/> and Joey Lee Dillard finds the idea "unconvincing".<ref>Joey Lee Dillard, ''Toward a Social History of American English''</ref> Cassidy mentions that the term might be related to {{cog|jam|braata||little extra given by a seller to a buyer}}, though he considers this "questionable" because "the stressed vowel is rather different [...] and the final ''-us'' of the American form would have to be accounted for"; the Jamaican term might derive from a {{etyl|es|-}} cognate of {{cog|pt|barato||favour}}.<ref name="Cassidy"/> An African origin has also been suggested, but not substantiated; ''The African Heritage of American English'' for example suggests derivation from an African word ''mbata'' meaning "something given on credit, without payment", but {{cog|kg|mbata}} in fact means "perquisite, commission, brokerage".<ref>W. Holman Bentley, ''Dictionary and Grammar of the Kongo Language'' (1887)</ref><!--
