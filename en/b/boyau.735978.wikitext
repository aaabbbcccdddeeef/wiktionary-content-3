In military [[fortification]], a '''boyau''' is a [[trench]] or [[ditch]] covered with a [[parapet]] that provided communication between two trenches, particularly the rear and front lines. Boyaus were typically constructed in a zigzag pattern to prevent exposure to direct enemy fire from the front.<ref>"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/hli/currents/earthworks/glossaryA_C.htm Military Earthworks Terms]".

A boyau is also a line, drawn winding about, in order to enclose several tracts of land, or to attack some works.<ref>{{1728}}</ref>
