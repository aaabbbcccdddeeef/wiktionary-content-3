In military [[fortification]], a '''boyau''' is a gut, or branch of the [[trench]]es, or a [[ditch]] covered with a [[parapet]], serving for a communication between two trenches. Boyaus were typically constructed in a zigzag pattern to prevent exposure to direct enemy fire from the front.<ref>"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/hli/currents/earthworks/glossaryA_C.htm Military Earthworks Terms]".

A boyau is also a line, drawn winding about, in order to enclose several tracts of land, or to attack some works.<ref>{{1728}}</ref>
