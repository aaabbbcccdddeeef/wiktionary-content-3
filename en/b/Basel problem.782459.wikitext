#*: As noted, some of Euler's contemporaries, while accepting his answer to the '''Basel Problem''', wondered about the validity of the argument that got him there.
#* '''2005''', Rajendra Bhatia, ''Fourier Series'', Mathematical Association of America, ISBN 0883857405, section 3.10, page 75,
#*: Solving '''the Basel problem''' was one of the early triumphs of L. Euler (1707â€“1783)...&nbsp;.
#* '''2007''', Charles Edward Sandifer,''The Early Mathematics of Leonhard Euler'', Mathematical Association of America, ISBN 0883855593, page 165,
#*: And so ends one of Euler's most famous papers. We see that Euler actually solves the '''Basel problem''' three times and that he does much more.
