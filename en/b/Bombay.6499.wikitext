====Usage notes====
As a proper noun, the term ''Bombay'' is obsolescent. The city has been officially named ''Mumbai'' since 1995, and this is name is the standard one in contemporary written usage, although "Bombay" is still common in spoken English and occasionally used in modern writing. However, ''Bombay'' remains in terms such as ''[[Bombay mix]]'' and ''[[Bombay duck]]'', which are seldom if ever referred to as ''Mumbai mix'' or ''Mumbai duck''.
