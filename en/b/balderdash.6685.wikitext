===Etymology===
Begin with Bowdlerize. Dr. Thomas Bowdler was a retired English practitioner and a leading light in the Society for the Suppression of Vice. He is credited with censoring many of Shakespeare's work and Edward Gibbon's,Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. (It's been speculated that his sister, Harriet,is actually responsible-which may explain why the 1st edition of the Family Shakespeare was published anonymously.After proven success, her brother stepped forward as its supposed editor). Nonetheless, the term bowdlerize was being used to describe any absurdly prudish form of literary censorship. With censorship often replacing a word with symbols such as @,#,!,%,etc, it's my theory that a "-" in lieu of a censored word became know as a Bowdlerdash. Perhaps when one asked the question "What are these characters in the middle of this sentence?",the response could have been "It's just a bowdlerdash". Instead of simply putting a "-" and leaving a blank for the reader to fill in on their own,the editor had to complicate things by inserting meaningless symbols to represent a word. Later,through mispronunciation,Balderdash.
