===Etymology===
Probably a {{calque|en|fr|courbe de Bézier|nocap=1}}. {{named-after|en|occ=Renault engineer|Pierre Bézier|wplink==}} who popularized the curves developed earlier by {{w|Paul de Casteljau}} and used them to design curves for the bodywork of cars.

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|mathematics|computer graphics}} A type of [[parametric]] curve defined by a set of [[control point]]s, two of which are the ends of the curve, while the others determine its shape. {{defdate|From 1960s.}}
#: {{ux|en|'''Bézier curves''' are applied, for example in [[computer graphics]] and [[animation]], to produce smooth, infinitely scalable curves.}}

#*: So, instead, it is often better to combine multiple '''Bézier curves''' to form a longer, more complicated curve called a ''piecewise '''Bézier curve'''''.
#*: This section discusses how to join '''Bézier curves''' together – especially how to join them so as to preserve continuity and smoothness (i.e., continuity of the first derivative).

#*: When an affine transformation is applied to the control points, the resulting '''Bézier curve''' with respect to the new control points coincides with the transformed '''Bézier curve'''. Therefore, '''Bézier curves''' are invariant under affine transformations like rotation, translation or scaling. '''Bézier curves''' are also symmetric with respect to their control points.
