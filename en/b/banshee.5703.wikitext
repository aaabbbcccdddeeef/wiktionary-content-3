{{en-noun}}

# In Irish [[folklore]], a female [[spirit]], usually taking the form of a woman whose [[mournful]] [[wail]]ing warns of an [[impend]]ing death. Originally a [[fairy]] woman singing a [[caoin|caoineadh]] ([[lament]]) for recently-deceased members of the O’Grady, the O’Neill, the O’Brien, the O’Connor, and the Kavanagh families, translations into English made a distinction between the banshee and other fairy folk that the original language and original stories do not seem to have, and thus the current image of the banshee.
