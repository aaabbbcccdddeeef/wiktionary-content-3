====Usage notes====
* Some usage guides claim that '''Between''' is correctly used when applied to two things, and that for more than two things, '''among''' should be used instead.  However, the OED writes, "V. 19. In all senses, between has been, from its earliest appearance, extended to more than two...it is still the only word available to express the relation of a thing to many surrounding things severally and individually, among expressing a relation to them collectively and vaguely: we should not say ‘the space lying among the three points,’ or ‘a treaty among three powers,’ or ‘the choice lies among the three candidates in the select list,’ or ‘to insert a needle among the closed petals of a flower.’"
