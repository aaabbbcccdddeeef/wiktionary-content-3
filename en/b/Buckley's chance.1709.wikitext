===Etymology===
Traditionally taken to refer to Australian convict [[w:William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] who escaped in 1803 and lived among Aborigines until 1835, survival in the bush being thought impossible.  But he died in 1875 which was well before the first recorded usages in the 1890s. One definition of the phrase would be that you have an extremely slim chance, if any.

===Noun===
'''[[Buckley]]’s [[chance]]''' (or ''[[Buckley’s]]'')

#(''Australian'') A very [[small]] [[chance]]
