===Etymology===
Uncertain.  Melbourne merchandising company, Buckley and Nunn (Buckley's) may be the true source of the expression. i.e. You have two chances, Buckley's and none... Hence the abbreviation to, "You've got Buckley's" when your chances of success are very low. Traditionally taken to refer to Australian convict [[w:William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] who escaped in 1803 and lived among Aborigines until 1835, survival in the bush being thought impossible.  But he died in 1875 which was well before the first recorded usages in the 1890s.
