===Etymology===
Uncertain.  Candidates are:

* [[w:William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] (1780-1856), a convict who escaped in [[Victoria]] in 1803 and lived among the [[aborigine]]s there for 30 years (survival in the bush was reckoned no chance).

* The expression [[Buckley's and none]] (see that article), if that derives from the [[Melbourne]] department store.

* A certain Mr Buckley in the [[w:Bombala|Bombala]] region of southern [[New South Wales]] who sued the government over title to land, the action seeming to have little prospect of success.  (Bill Wannan, ''Australian Folklore'', Lansdowne Press, 1970, reprint 1979 ISBN 0-7018-1309-1, entry for "Buckley's Chance", correspondance from a Mr F. Verdich of Rockdale, NSW.)

William Buckley is the traditional candidate, but has the problem that the earliest uses found are from the 1890s, some 30 years after his death.  (Reference: [http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/ozwords/Oct%202000/Buckley%27s.html Ozwords October 2000 at the Australian National University].)
