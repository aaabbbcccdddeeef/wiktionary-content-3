{{en-noun|s|Baraitot}}

# Any of various [[Jewish]] [[tradition]]s that are not included in the [[Mishnah]]

===Etymology===

[[Aramaic]] <i>baraita</i>, an extraneous teaching. The word appears in the feminine (<i>baraita</i> rather than <i>bara'ah</i>), because it is actually short for <i>matnita baraita</i>, external Mishnah or teaching (and <i>matnita</i> is feminine).
