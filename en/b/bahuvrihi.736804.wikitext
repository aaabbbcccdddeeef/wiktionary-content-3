# {{context|linguistics|lang=en}} A type of [[nominal]] [[compound]] in which the first part modifies the second and neither part alone conveys the intended meaning.
#* '''1986''', Alan Jeffrey Nussbaum, ''Head and Horn in Indo-European'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=4xKMgV5OeIEC&pg=PA273&dq=%22bahuvrihi%22%7C%22bahuvrihis%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qVdNUu7WBaToiAeJ3oG4DA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22bahuvrihi%22%7C%22bahuvrihis%22&f=false page 273],
#*: It would therefore not be surprising if unambiguous '''bahuvrihi''' morphology were to be used occasionally in a governing compound.
#* '''1997''', ''Prague Studies in English'', Volume 22, Universita Karlova, [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=SvpZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22bahuvrihi%22%7C%22bahuvrihis%22&dq=%22bahuvrihi%22%7C%22bahuvrihis%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qVdNUu7WBaToiAeJ3oG4DA&redir_esc=y page 16],
#*: At the same time, none of the extended adjectival '''bahuvrihis''' has its linear counterpart in either poem.

#*: Thus, '''bahuvrihi''' compounds have some kind of an identifying function. Marchand provides the following explanation for the origins of '''bahuvrihi''' compounds: they were used very early in Indo-European languages, primarily for namegiving, but most of them functioned only as adjectives.
