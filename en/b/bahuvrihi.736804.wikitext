Thus, as Patañjali illustrates, if you say: 'there march the priests having red turbans on,' the '''Bahuvrîhi''' ''lohitoshńísháh'' 'having red turbans on' implies here an essential quality of the priests, since this quality cannot be disconnected from their appearance as they march.}}

[[w:Hans Marchand|[Hans] Marchand]] defines these as expressions which denote somebody (or something) which can be characterised by the feature expressed by the compound. Thus, '''bahuvrihi''' compounds have some kind of an identifying function. Marchand provides the following explanation for the origins of '''bahuvrihi''' compounds: they were used very early in Indo-European languages, primarily for namegiving, but most of them functioned only as adjectives.}}
