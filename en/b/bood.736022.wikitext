===Noun===
'''bood''' is an ''internet meme'' which was started by an anonymous stranger during an ''Omegle'' chatting session with ''Beckii Cruel aka Rebecca Flint'' during November of 2010.
Nobody is certain of what the term '''bood''' means, but based on the context of how it was used, it might be a slang term for the word '''body''' or for the word '''booty'''.
The term is so catchy that it sprouted the mock-religion of '''Boodism''' which began spreading through ''Ustream'' and ''Twitter'' and ''FormSpring''.
