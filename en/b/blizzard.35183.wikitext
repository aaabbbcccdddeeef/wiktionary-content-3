==English==

===Etymology===
''Origins Unknown''. Possibly from ''blizzard'', a [[surname]] dating back to the 1700's(?). The earliest known use of ''blizzard'' as a term was in the [[W:Estherville, Iowa|Estherville, Iowa]], ''Northern Vindicator'' on 23 April 1870.  One week later it appeared again in the same newspaper, only with the now common double-z spelling.  Best evidence is that the word was coined in that area of Iowa some years prior to this use.

The ''blizzard'' surname possibly comes from the ''blizzard'' one, dating back to the 1500's(?).

The word blizzard was used (not in relation to the weather) in America in the early 1800s. It meant a "sharp blow or knock; a shot" (usually gunfire) and later shifted meaning.
