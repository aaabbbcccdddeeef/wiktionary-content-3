* The verb {{term||be|lang=en}} is the most irregular non-defective verb in Standard English. Unlike other verbs, which distinguish at most five forms (as in {{term||do|lang=en}}–{{term||does|lang=en}}–{{term||doing|lang=en}}–{{term||did|lang=en}}–{{term||done|lang=en}}), {{term||be|lang=en}} distinguishes eight:
** {{term||Be|lang=en}} itself is the plain form, used as the infinitive, as the imperative, and as the present subjunctive.
**:: ''I want to '''be''' a father someday.'' (infinitive)
**:: ''If that '''be''' true...'' (present subjunctive)
**:: ''Allow the truth to '''be''' heard!'' (infinitive)<!--As it stood, "Let the truth be heard", it could have been interpreted just as validly as a subjunctive. This version eliminates the ambiguity.-->
**:: ''Please '''be''' here by eight o'clock.'' (imperative)
**:: ''The librarian asked that the rare books not '''be''' touched.'' (present subjunctive)
**: {{term||Be|lang=en}} is also used as the present tense indicative form in the alternate, dynamic / lexical conjugation of ''be'':
**:: ''What do we do? We '''be''' ourselves.'' ''[[w:Bratz: The Movie|Bratz: The Movie]]'' (first-person plural present indicative, lexical be)
**:: but: ''Who '''are''' we? We '''are''' human beings.'' (first-person plural present indicative, copula be)
**: It is also an archaic alternative form of the indicative, especially in the plural[http://books.google.fr/books?id=q3QSAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA357&lpg=PA357&dq=mood+tense+of+be+in+%22I+be%22&source=bl&ots=mjI9wpNsbf&sig=mCMwoBB65B9i6GvFTaOhErLON78&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZUogT7TkGKaksQLgyoSTDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mood%20tense%20of%20be%20in%20%22I%20be%22&f=false]:
**:: ''The [[powers that be|powers that '''be''']], are ordained of God.'' (Romans 13:1, Tyndale Bible, 1526)
**:: ''We are true men; we are no spies: We '''be''' twelve brethren...'' (Genesis 42:31-2, King James Version, 1611)
**:: ''I think it '''be''' thine indeed, for thou liest in it.'' (Hamlet, Act V, Scene 1, circa 1600)
** {{term|am|Am|lang=en}}, {{term|are|lang=en}}, and {{term|is|lang=en}} are the forms of the present indicative. {{term||Am|lang=en}} is the first-person singular (used with {{term||I|lang=en}}); {{term||is|lang=en}} is the third-person singular (used with {{term||he|lang=en}}, {{term||she|lang=en}}, {{term||it|lang=en}} and other subjects that would be used with {{term||does|lang=en}} rather than {{term||do|lang=en}}); and {{term||are|lang=en}} is both the second-person singular and the plural (used with {{term||we|lang=en}}, {{term||you|lang=en}}, {{term||they|lang=en}}, and any other plural subjects).
**: '''''Am''' I in the right place?'' (first-person singular present indicative)
**: ''You '''are''' even taller than your brother!'' (second-person singular present indicative)
**: ''Where '''is''' the library?'' (third-person singular present indicative)
**: ''These '''are''' the biggest shoes we have.'' (plural present indicative)
** {{term|was|Was|lang=en}} and {{term|were|lang=en}} are the forms of the past indicative and past subjunctive (like {{term||did|lang=en}}). In the past indicative, {{term||was|lang=en}} is the first– and third-person singular (used with {{term||I|lang=en}}, as well as with {{term||he|lang=en}}, {{term||she|lang=en}}, {{term||it|lang=en}} and other subjects that would be used with {{term||does|lang=en}} rather than {{term||do|lang=en}}), and {{term||were|lang=en}} is both the second-person singular and the plural (used with {{term||we|lang=en}}, {{term||you|lang=en}}, {{term||they|lang=en}}, and any other plural subjects). In the traditional past subjunctive, {{term||were|lang=en}} is used with all subjects, though many speakers do not actually distinguish the past subjunctive from the past indicative, and therefore use {{term||was|lang=en}} with first– and third-person singular subjects even in cases where other speakers would use {{term||were|lang=en}}.
**: ''I '''was''' out of town.'' (first-person singular past indicative)
**: ''You '''were''' the first person here.'' (second-person singular past indicative)
**: ''The room '''was''' dirty.'' (third-person singular past indicative)
**: ''We '''were''' angry at each other.'' (plural past indicative)
**: ''I wish I '''were''' more sure.'' (first-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also possible, though considered less correct)
**: ''If she '''were''' here, she would know what to do.'' (third-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also possible, though considered less correct)
** {{term|being|Being|lang=en}} is the gerund and present participle, used in noun-like constructions, in the progressive aspect, and after various verbs (like {{term||doing|lang=en}}). (It's also used as an actual noun; for those senses, see the entry for {{term|being|lang=en}} itself.)
**: ''I don't like '''being''' here.'' (gerund)
**: ''All of a sudden, he's '''being''' nice to everyone.'' (present participle in the progressive aspect)
**: ''It won't stop '''being''' a problem until someone does something about it.'' (present participle in the progressive aspect)
** {{term|been|Been|lang=en}} is the past participle, used in the perfect aspect. In Middle English, it was also the infinitive.
**: ''It's '''been''' that way for a week and a half.''
* In archaic or obsolete forms of English, with the pronoun {{term|thou|lang=en}}, the verb {{term||be|lang=en}} has a few additional forms:
** When the pronoun {{term||thou|lang=en}} was in regular use, the forms {{term|art|lang=en}}, {{term|wast|lang=en}}, and {{term|wert|lang=en}} were the corresponding present indicative, past indicative, and past subjunctive, respectively.
** As {{term||thou|lang=en}} became less common and more highly marked, a special present-subjunctive form {{term|beest|lang=en}} developed (replacing the regular present subjunctive form {{term||be|lang=en}}, still used with all other subjects). Additionally, the form {{term||wert|lang=en}}, previously a past subjunctive form, came to be used as a past indicative as well.
* The forms {{term||am|lang=en}}, {{term||is|lang=en}}, and {{term||are|lang=en}} can contract with preceding subjects: {{term|I'm|I’m|I am|lang=en}}, {{term|'s|’s|is|lang=en}}, {{term|'re|’re|are|lang=en}}. The form {{term||are|lang=en}} most commonly contracts with personal pronouns ({{term|we're|we’re|we are|lang=en}}, {{term|you're|you’re|you are|lang=en}}, {{term|they're|they’re|they are|lang=en}}), but contractions with other subjects is possible; the form {{term||is|lang=en}} contracts quite freely with a variety of subjects. These contracted forms, however, are possible only when there is an explicit, non-preposed complement, and they cannot be stressed; therefore, contraction does not occur in sentences such as the following:
*: ''Who's here? —I '''am'''.''
*: ''I wonder what it '''is'''.''
*: ''I don't want to be involved. —But you '''''are''''' involved, regardless.''
* Several of the finite forms of {{term||be|lang=en}} have special negative forms, containing the suffix {{term|-n't|-n’t|lang=en}}, that can be used instead of adding the adverb {{term|not|lang=en}}. Specifically, the forms {{term||is|lang=en}}, {{term||are|lang=en}}, {{term||was|lang=en}}, and {{term||were|lang=en}} have the negative forms {{term|isn't|isn’t|lang=en}}, {{term|aren't|aren’t|lang=en}}, {{term|wasn't|wasn’t|lang=en}}, and {{term|weren't|weren’t|lang=en}}. The form {{term||be|lang=en}} itself does not, even in finite uses, with “not be” being used in the present subjunctive and “do not be” or “don’t be” (or, in dated use, “be not”) being used in the imperative. The form {{term||am|lang=en}} has the negative forms {{term|aren't|aren’t|lang=en}}, {{term|amn't|amn’t|lang=en}}, and arguably {{term|ain't|ain’t|lang=en}}, but all of these are in restricted use; see their entries for details.
* Outside of Standard English, there is some variation in usage of some forms; some dialects, for example, use {{term||is|lang=en}} or {{term||’s|lang=en}} throughout the present indicative (supplanting, in whole or in part, {{term||am|lang=en}} and {{term||are|lang=en}}), and/or {{term||was|lang=en}} throughout the past indicative and past subjunctive (supplanting {{term||were|lang=en}}).

====Usage notes====
When used copulatively with a pronoun, traditional grammar puts the pronoun in the [[nominative case]] ({{term||I|lang=en}}, {{term||he|lang=en}}, {{term||she|lang=en}}, {{term||we|lang=en}}, {{term||they|lang=en}}) rather than the [[objective case]] ({{term||me|lang=en}}, {{term||him|lang=en}}, {{term||her|lang=en}}, {{term||us|lang=en}}, {{term||them|lang=en}}), regardless of which side of the copula it is placed. For example, "''I was the masked man''" and "''The masked man was I''" would both be considered correct, while "''The masked man was me''" and "''Me was the masked man''" would both be incorrect. However, most colloquial speech treats the verb ''be'' as transitive, in which case the pronoun is used in the objective case if it occurs after the copula: "''I was the masked man''" but "''The masked man was me''". This paradigm applies even if the copula is linking two pronouns - "''I am her''" but "''She is me''" (versus the traditional "''I am she''" and "''She is I''") and "''Am I me?''" (versus the traditional "''Am I I?''").

They are simply long A, long E, etc. (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). Nor is there any uncertainty with respect to the six mutes B, C, D, G, P, T. Their names are bē, cē, dē, gē, pē, tē (each with a long E). Or about H, K, and Q: they are hā, kā, kū—each, again, with a long vowel sound."
