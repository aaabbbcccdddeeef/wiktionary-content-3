====Usage notes====
It is somewhat common to hear native English speakers (particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Britain) using "'''brought'''" when in place of "[[bought]]" (and [[vice versa]]) despite the fact that the two words mean different things [http://wordconstructions.com.au/blog/2008/10/bought-or-brought/][http://www.beedictionary.com/common-errors/bought_vs_brought]. Sometimes this variation makes its way into print[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304040514/http://thehoopla.com.au/relinquished/], [https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Diaries_Damsels_and_Dastardly_Deeds/NlskEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22brought+the+house%7Cproperty%7Cbusiness+from+them%22&pg=PT18&printsec=frontcover], [https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Journal_of_Further_Explorations_in_the_K/fOgtq8NjWusC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22I%7Cyou%7Che%7Cshe%7Cit%7Cwe%7Cthey+bring%7Cbrings%7Cbrought+it+from+me%7Cyou%7Chim%7Cher%7Cit%7Cus%7Cthem%22&pg=PA122&printsec=frontcover].
