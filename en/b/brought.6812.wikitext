====Usage notes====
It is somewhat common to hear native English speakers (particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Britain) using "'''brought'''" when in place of "[[bought]]" (and [[vice versa]]) despite the fact that the two words mean different things [http://wordconstructions.com.au/blog/2008/10/bought-or-brought/][http://www.beedictionary.com/common-errors/bought_vs_brought]. Sometimes this variation makes its way into print[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304040514/http://thehoopla.com.au/relinquished/].
