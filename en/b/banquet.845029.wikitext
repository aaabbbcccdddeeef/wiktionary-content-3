A '''banquet''' is a large public [[meal]] or feast, complete with main courses and desserts.  It usually serves a purpose, such as a charitable gathering, a ceremony, or a celebration.  Sometimes a banquet consists of only desserts, but
it is advisable to include main courses as well.

In catering and event planning, a banquet is always a plated or "sit-down" meal. A banquet is never a buffet meal, a station meal or an hors d'oeuvre service.

A banquet requires a minimum of six pieces of china per person; often more. The six pieces of china: bread-and-butter plate, cup, saucer, salad plate, luncheon or dinner plate, and dessert plate.
