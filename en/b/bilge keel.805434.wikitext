A bilge keel is a strake, or small keel or blister, running along much of the length of the hull. It is used to increase the resistance to rolling of the hull. They are typically fitted low down on the side of the hull, so as not to increase the draft of the vessel. In battleships they were often quite large and used as part of the torpedo protection system.
