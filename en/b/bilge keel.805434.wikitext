[[Image:bilgekeel.jpg|right|thumb|A bilge keel.]]A [[bilge]] [[keel]] is a [[Strake#Boatbuilding|strake]], or small keel or blister, running along much of the length of the hull. It is used to reduce the hull's tendency to roll. They are typically fitted one on each side, low down on the side of the hull, so as not to increase the [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of the vessel. In battleships they were often quite large and used as part of the [[torpedo]] protection system.
