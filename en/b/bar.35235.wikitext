===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|barre}}, from {{der|en|fro|barre|t=beam, bar, gate, barrier}}, from {{der|en|VL.|*barra}}, of uncertain origin. {{doublet|en|barre}}. Perhaps from {{der|en|frk|*bara|t=bar, beam, barrier, fence}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*barō|t=beam, bar, barrier}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*bʰerH-|t=to strike, pierce}}. If so, then cognate with {{cog|goh|para}}, {{m|goh|bara|t=bar, beam, one's cherished land}}, {{cog|ofs|ber|t=attack, assault}}, {{cog|sv|bärling|t=a spoke}}, {{cog|no|berling|t=a small bar in a vehicle, rod}}, {{cog|la|forus|t=gangway, plank}}, {{cog|ru|забо́р|t=fencing, paling, fence}} and {{m|ru|бор}}, {{cog|grc|φάρος|t=piece of land, furrow, marker, beacon, lighthouse}}. May well have been reinforced by existing Old English term from the same root.
