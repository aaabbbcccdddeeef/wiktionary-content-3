====Usage notes====
* The transitive verb ''believe'' and the phrasal verb ''[[believe in]]'' are similar but can have very different implications.
** To “believe” someone or something means to accept specific pieces of information as truth: ''believe the news'', ''believe the lead witness''. To “believe a complete stranger” means to accept a stranger's story with little evidence.
** To “believe in” someone or something means to place faith in that person or concept: ''believe in liberty'', ''believe in God''. To “believe in one's fellow man” means to place faith in mankind.
* Meanings sometimes overlap. To ''believe in'' a religious text would also require affirming at least the major principles. To ''believe'' a religious text would likewise imply placing one's faith in it.
