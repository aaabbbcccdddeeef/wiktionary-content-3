====Usage notes====
The transitive verb ''believe'' and the phrasal verb ''[[believe in]]'' are similar and sometimes overlap, but can have very different implications. To “believe” someone or something means to accept a specific piece of information: ''believe a complete stranger'', ''believe the news'', ''believe the lead witness''. To “believe in” someone or something means to place faith in that person or concept: ''believe in God'', ''believe in liberty'', ''believe in one's fellow man''.
