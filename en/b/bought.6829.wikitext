|passage=In America alone, people spent $170 billion on “direct marketing”—junk mail of both the physical and electronic varieties—last year. Yet of those who received unsolicited adverts through the post, only 3% '''bought''' anything as a result. If the bumf arrived electronically, the take-up rate was 0.1%. And for online adverts the “conversion” into sales was a minuscule 0.01%.}}
#: {{ux|en|She '''bought''' an expensive bag last week.}}
#: {{ux|en|People have '''bought''' gas masks.}}
#: {{ux|en|Our products can be '''bought''' at your local store.}}

=====Usage notes=====
It is common to hear native English speakers (particularly in the UK, Australia and New Zealand) using "'''bought'''" when meaning "[[brought]]" (and [[vice versa]]) despite the fact that the two words mean different things [http://wordconstructions.com.au/blog/2008/10/bought-or-brought/][http://www.beedictionary.com/common-errors/bought_vs_brought]. Sometimes this mistake makes its way into print[http://thehoopla.com.au/relinquished/].

=====Derived terms=====
* {{l|en|overbought}}
