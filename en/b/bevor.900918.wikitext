# {{historical}} A portion of [[plate armour]] to protect the lower face and the neck, typically in two parts, called [[upper]] bevor and [[lower]] bevor.
#* '''2001''', Paul B. Newman, ''Daily life in the Middle Ages'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=1-mss7-OStgC&pg=PA210&dq=%22bevors%22+-intitle:%22%22+-inauthor:%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QMF2T7HBCOHJmQXYprjpDw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22bevors%22%20-intitle%3A%22%22%20-inauthor%3A%22%22&f=false page 210],
#*: Since gorgets completely encircled the neck, they were usually more articulated than the '''bevors''' to allow for some movement of the neck and head. '''Bevors''' typically were open in back but extended up above the wearer′s jaw on the sides and front. Use of a '''bevor''' or a gorget depended upon the type of helmet the knight wore{{...}}.
#* '''2008''', Christopher Gravett, ''Knight: Noble Warrior of England 1200-1600'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=igao_V9rBHwC&pg=PA233&dq=%22bevor%22|%22bevors%22+-intitle:%22%22+-inauthor:%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=srl2T8DaF-6WiQfcvsSABQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22bevor%22|%22bevors%22%20-intitle%3A%22%22%20-inauthor%3A%22%22&f=false page 233],
#*: For heavy field use a reinforcing breastplate was sometimes added, together with a wrapper over the upper '''bevor'''.
