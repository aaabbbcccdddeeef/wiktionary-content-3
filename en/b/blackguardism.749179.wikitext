#* '''1888''': Collectively, I think, but am not certain, they are the worst men in the regiment so far as genial '''blackguardism''' goes. — Rudyard Kipling, ‘The Three Musketeers’, ''Plain Tales from the Hills'' (Folio Society 2005, p. 49)
#* '''1829''': The shoutings of the mob exhilarated the pelters and induced many who came as spectators to join in the mischief, and when the '''blackguardism''' had reached its height, it was no longer in the power of the constables to stay it, every sort of missile was thrown, a dead cat was a treat, a live one a still greater treat, and woe to the poor animal who fell into the hands of the miscreants. - Francis Place (Diary of Social Reformer Francis Place)
