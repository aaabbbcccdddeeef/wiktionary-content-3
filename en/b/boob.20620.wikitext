===Etymology===
Short for {{term|booby}}. The noun sense "breast" dates to 1945, while the noun sense "dummy" dates to 1909.

And alternate and more likely etymology is that the word "boob" (meaning breast) is derived from German/Yiddish, although the word probably crept into American English more from Yiddish than German.

In German the word for breasts is "Busen" (pronounced BOOZ-en, and related to our English word "bosom").  However, the German word for "boys" is "Buben" (pronounced BOOB-en), which provides an obvious pun for the German word for breasts.  And so it quickly became a common euphemism.  The singular of Buben is "Bube", which is often shortened to just "Bub'" (pronounced BOOB).

For illustration, if you've ever seen the movie Blazing Saddles, there's a scene where Mel Brooks, playing the Governor, is staring at the chest of his scantily-clad secretary.  It's at this point that he exclaims "Hello boys!"  (See http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3261175808/nm0385301)
