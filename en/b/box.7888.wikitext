===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|box||jar (usually cylindrical); type of container; strongbox for valuables or its contents; cupping glass for bloodletting; bone socket}}, from {{inh|en|ang|box||box-tree; box, case}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|part of speech=''n.''(2)|noformat=yes|id=MED5758|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref> from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*buhsuz||box tree; thing made from boxwood; box}}, either from {{der|en|la|buxus||box tree; thing made from boxwood}}, {{m|la|buxum||box tree; boxwood}} (possibly from {{m|grc|πύξος||box tree; boxwood}}); or from {{der|en|LL.|buxis||box}}, {{der|en|la|pyxis||small box for medicines or toiletries}} (from {{der|en|grc|πυξίς||box or tablet made of boxwood; box; cylinder}}, from {{m|grc|πύξος}} + {{m|grc|-ῐς||''suffix forming feminine nouns''}}).<ref name="OED n2">Compare {{R:OED Online|part of speech=''n.''{{sup|2}}|noformat=yes|id=22297|date=1887}}</ref>

If the latter derivation is correct, the word is cognate with {{cog|dum|bosse}}, {{m|dum|busse||jar; tin; round box}} (modern {{cog|nl|bos||wood, forest}}, {{m|nl|bus||container, box; [[bushing]] of a wheel}}), {{cog|goh|buhsa}} ({{cog|gmh|buhse}}, {{m|gmh|bühse}}, modern {{cog|de|Büchse||box; can}}), {{cog|sv|hjulbössa||wheel-box}}.<ref name="OED n2"/>

The humorous {{glossary|plural}} form {{m|en|boxen}} is from ''box'' + {{m|en|-en}}, by analogy with {{m|en|oxen}}.

===Etymology 3===
[[File:Fotos produzidas pelo Senado (30919118135).jpg|thumb|A woman practising boxing in [[Brazil]]]]

From {{inh|en|enm|box||a blow; a stroke with a weapon}};<ref>{{R:MED Online|part of speech=''n.''(3)|noformat=yes|id=MED5759|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref> further origin uncertain. The following etymologies have been suggested:<ref>{{R:OED Online|part of speech=''n.''{{sup|3}}|noformat=yes|id=22298|date=1887}}</ref>

* Possibly related to {{inh|en|gem-pro|*boki-}}, whence {{cog|da|bask||a blow; a stripe}}, {{cog|da|baske|t=to flap, move around, beat violently}},  {{cog|dum|boke||a blow, a hit}}, {{m|dum|bōken||to slap, strike}} (modern {{cog|nl|beuken|t=to slap}}), {{cog|fy|bûtse}}, {{m|fy|bûtsje|t=to slap}}, {{cog|stq|batsje|t=to slap}}, {{cog|nds|betschen|t=to slap, beat with a flat hand}}, {{cog|gmh|buc||a blow, a stroke}}, {{m|gmh|bochen||to slap, strike}}.
* Possibly {{glossary|onomatopoeic}}.
* Possibly from ''[[box#Noun|box]]'' (“cuboid space; container”), perhaps referring to the shape of the [[fist#Noun|fist]].
* Possibly from {{cog|grc|πύξ||with clenched fist}}, {{m|grc|πυγμή||fist; boxing}}.

The verb is from {{inh|en|enm|boxen||to beat or whip (an animal)}}, which is derived from the noun.<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=boxen|part of speech=''v.''(2)|noformat=yes|id=MED5761|accessdate=23 August 2018|nodot=yes}}; {{R:OED Online|part of speech=''v.''{{sup|2}}|noformat=yes|id=22300|date=1887}}</ref>
