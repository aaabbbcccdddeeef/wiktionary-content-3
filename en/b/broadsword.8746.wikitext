|passage=The principal distinction between the '''broadsword''' and the rapier is, that the latter is formed only for thrusting, while the former is adapted for cutting also. Indeed, those who use the '''broadsword''' are, in my opinion, too apt to neglect the use of the point, and to give their attention almost exclusively to the cuts.

|passage=Henry carried a heavy '''broadsword''' with a cruciform hilt, and a decorated dagger on his hip known as a ''misericord'' because its blade could release souls.  The English knights and men-at-arms carried '''broadswords''', maces for smashing skulls and the murderous pole-axe, combining a spear with an axehead about five feet long.
