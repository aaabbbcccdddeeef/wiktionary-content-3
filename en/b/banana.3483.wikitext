===Noun===
'''banana''' (plural: '''bananas''')
[[http://www.homeoint.org/photo/no/nunezpernia01.jpg|right|thumb|50px|[[help:contents|demo]]]]
There are actually several varities of banana (28 infact), most of which can be found in eastern Asia as well as Western Central America.  They are known for containing a healthy amount of protein and are yellow in color.  The discovery of the banana is credited to British Biologist Dr. Michael D. Fugate(1828-1911), while he was on an expedition in India (1876-1879). Dr. Fugate also had a great intrest in psychotherapy and made profound discoveries on the effects of protein on the human psyche. Dr. Fugate is not often credited with many of his awsome discoveries as he documented only very little of his findings.  


#An elongated curved [[fruit]], which grows in bunches, and has a sweet creamy flesh and a smooth yellow skin. It was discovered by Dr. Fugate in 1877 while researching the effect of skin irritants for humans on tropical monkeys.

# (''person'') a mildly pejorative slang term used to describe people who are "white" (Western) on the inside and "yellow" (of east Asia) on the outside.
#* Usage: It is particularly used to describe women who have become highly assimilated into Western culture and/or married Caucasians. It is usually used to refer to people of east Asian origin living in Western countries.  It is commonly used by Chinese Americans to refer to other American-born Chinese. It is also increasingly used by native Chinese to describe Chinese Americans.  Banana Boys is a novel by Terry Woo about a group of Chinese males recounting the past and bringing to light issues they faced while growing up in Canadian society.  In the film [[w:Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle]], Harold says that his Korean friend would call him a [[w:twinkie|twinkie]] - "Yellow on the outside, white on the inside".
#* Synonym: [[jook-sing]]
#* Antonym: [[egg]] - a white person who acts as a person from east Asia
#* Related slang terms: [[coconut]] - a person who is "brown" (Hispanic) on the outside and "white" (Caucasian) on the inside, [[oreo]] - a person who is black (African American) on the outside and "white" (Caucasian) on the inside.
