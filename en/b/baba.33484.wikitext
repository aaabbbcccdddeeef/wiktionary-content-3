===Etymology===
As one of the first utterances many babies are able to say, {{term|baba}} (like {{term|mama}}, {{term|papa}}, and {{term|dada}}) has come to be used in many languages as a term for various family members:
* [[father]]:  Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Hindi, Bengali, Persian, Swahili
* [[grandmother]]:  many Slavic language (such as Bulgarian, Russian and Polish), Yiddish, Japanese
* [[baby]]:  Afrikaans
These terms often continue to be used by English speakers whose families came from one of these cultures. In some cases, they may become more widely used in localities that have been heavily influenced by an immigrant community. Some senses were extensions of one of these family terms in the original languages ("old woman" from "grandmother", "holy man" from "father"). The "cake" sense comes through {{etyl|fr}} from {{etyl|pl}} {{term|baba||old woman|lang=pl}}. The Middle Eastern word {{term|baba}} (as in {{term|Ali Baba}}) is rather a term of endearment, and is ultimately derived from {{etyl|fa}} {{term|sc=fa-Arab|بابا|tr=bābā||father|lang=fa}} (from {{etyl|peo}} {{term||pāpa|lang=peo}}; as opposed to the Arabic words {{term|sc=Arab|ابو|tr=’ábu|lang=ar}} and {{term|sc=Arab|أب|tr=’ab|lang=ar}}, as well as the Turkish word {{term|ata|lang=tr}}; see also [[w:Papak|Papak]]) , and is linguistically related to the common European word {{term|papa}} and the word {{term|pope}}, having the same [[w:Indo-European languages|Indo-European origin]].
