====Usage notes====
* In the United States, ''black'' typically refers to people of African descent, including indirect African descent via the Caribbean, including those with light skin. In the United Kingdom, ''black'' often includes dark-skinned Asians. In Australian, Aboriginal Australians are often referred to as or identify as ''black''. In New Zealand, Maoris are sometimes referred to as or identify as ''black''.<ref>Mark Williams, "Ethnicity and Authenticity", in ''Comparative Literary Dimensions: Essays in Honor of Melvin J. Friedman'', edited by Melvin J. Friedman, Jay L. Halio, Ben Siegel, University of Delaware Press (2000, {{ISBN|9780874137156}}), page 194: "'Black' means very different things in different places. In America the word black usually means descended from Africa; East Indians are not generally defined as black there. In Britain, however, Asians often designate themselves as black. In New Zealand, Maori radicals sometimes use the world because it points to their difference from the dominant white culture in terms conveniently binary. Even vaguer uses of the word can be seen, such as the expression &quot;Black Irish,&quot; which refers to Irish people supposedly descended from Spanish sailors, or &quot; Black Maoris,&quot; who are believed by other Maoris to be descended from black sailors who jumped ship in the northern parts of New Zealand in the early contact period."</ref><ref>Carolyn Whitzman, ''The Handbook of Community Safety Gender and Violence Prevention: Practical Planning Tools'', Routledge (2012, {{ISBN|9781136553714}}), page 46:"the term 'black' refers to many different groups, depending upon the country where it is used. In the US, black means African-Americans, usually descendants of slaves, although there are a growing number of recent black migrants from the Caribbean and Africa. In Canada, black means people of African origin as well, usually first- or second-generation migrants from the Caribbean, although there is a smaller, more established, community descended from refugees from slavery in th US. In the UK, black usually means people of South Asian descent, who may be new migrants or who may be second- or third-generation citizens. In Australia, black means the indigenous people or Aboriginal Australians, who are descendants of inhabitants who predated European settlement by over 40,000 years. In South Africa, black means the indigenous peoples as well {{...}}"</ref><ref>[//www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html US Census Bureau definitions of racial groups]; [//www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html PBS article on American use]</ref><ref>See [[Citations:black]].</ref>

|passage=C’est qu’en France, les blancs n’existent pas et par contre la façon de parler des nonblancs existe et évolue avec le temps. Parce qu’effectivement, d’abord on était sur des termes purement et simplement racistes avec « bamboula, negro, nègre, bicot, bougnoule » et puis après ça a évolué et on est arrivé à « '''black''', beur »… Donc je sais pas quand est-ce que ça a commencé exactement, moi je marque ça aux années 80, le hip hop, voilà, la black music…
|translation=In France, there are no Whites, but names for non-Whites are constantly evolving. First we had terms that were purely and simply racist, like jigaboo, negro, nigger, coon, sambo... That evolved until we got to '''Black''', Brownie... I'm not sure when that came in, but I guess it was the 1980s, with hip-hop and "Black music."}}
