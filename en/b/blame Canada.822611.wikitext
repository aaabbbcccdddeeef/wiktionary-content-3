===Etymology===
Jokes about [[Canada]] in the [[United States]] and [[visa versa]] are not new, but the specific satirical practice of blaming Canada for problems facing the U.S. entered widespread usage following the inclusion of an eponymous song in the film ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut''. The song and phrase became popular in part due to the perception that, as the country's northern [[neighbor]], largest trading partner and one of its strongest allies, Canada is among the least threatening forces in the world, as well as the very real perception by some conservatives in the U.S. that concepts like gay marriage and universal health care, which exist in Canada, are having a negative influence on the U.S. The song's first and last lines belie the latter sense: "We must blame them and cause a fuss / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!"
