== Brownbagging ==


Brownbagging is the agricultural practice of planting seed saved from the farmers own harvest, as opposed to buying new seed from a seed company.

More recently it has the alternate definition of illegally saving seeds for sale or replanting. That is, many plant varieties are patented or otherwise owned by some entity (often a corporation), and replanting proprietary seeds from those plants without permission from that entity is illegal.

[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]] established that companies may obtain patents for lifeforms. [http://neuro.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/display.html?terms=patent&url=/supct/html/99-1996.ZS.html J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer] established that brownbagging is a patent violation.
