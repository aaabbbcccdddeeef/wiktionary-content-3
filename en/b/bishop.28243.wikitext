=====Usage notes=====
Generally speaking, Christian churches observe their highest positions&mdash;[[pope]]s, [[patriarch]]s, [[archbishop]]s, etc.&mdash;as specially-empowered bishops; thus the [[Pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is the [[Bishop of Rome]], while the [[Pope]] of the [[Coptic Church]] is nominally bishop of [[Alexandria]] though resident in [[Cairo]]. In several denominations, the [[charism]] of a [[laying on of hands]] is believed to introduce new bishops to an unbroken [[apostolic succession]] initiated by the [[Holy Spirit]] (also called the [[Holy Ghost]]) at [[Pentecost]] described in the 2nd chapter of the [[Book of Acts]].

Traditionally, the rank of bishop has been restricted to men and many conservative denominations continue this practice. Even denominations permitting the marriage of priests (such as Eastern Orthodoxy) typically require complete [[celibacy]] from those promoted to [[bishophood]]: owing to traditional aversions to divorce, this usually restricts the rank to single men and [[widower]]s. Catholic bishops are also priests; Eastern Orthodox bishops are usually (but not always) monks.
