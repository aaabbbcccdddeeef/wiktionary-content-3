=====Usage notes=====
Generally speaking, Christian churches observe their highest positions&mdash;[[pope]]s, [[patriarch]]s, [[archbishop]]s, etc.&mdash;as specially-empowered bishops; thus the [[Pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is the [[Bishop of Rome]], while the [[Pope]] of the [[Coptic Church]] is nominally bishop of [[Alexandria]] though resident in [[Cairo]]. In several denominations, the [[charism]] of a [[laying on of hands]] is believed to introduce new bishops to an unbroken [[apostolic succession]] initiated by the [[Holy Ghost]] at the [[Pentecost]] described in the 2nd chapter of the [[Book of Acts]].

Traditionally, the rank of bishop has been restricted to men and many denominations continue this practice. Even denominations permitting the marriage of priests (such as Eastern Orthodoxy) typically require complete celibacy from those promoted to bishophood: owing to traditional aversions to divorce, this usually restricts the rank to single men and [[widower]]s. Catholic bishops are also priests; Eastern Orthodox bishops are usually (but not always) monks.
