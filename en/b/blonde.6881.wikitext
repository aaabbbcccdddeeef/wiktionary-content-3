==English==
===Etymology===
from Middle French "''blonde''" (feminine). The masculine form of the word is "''blond''." 

In the English language, it is only one a few distinct words where the gender differentiation is actually reflected in the spelling of the word (i.e. ''She is a blonde woman.'' vs. ''He is a blond man.''), even though this is a relatively common occurrence in other languages.

"''Blond(e)''" has only recently been borrowed into English from French; the traditional English terms for lightly-colored hair are "''[[fair]]-haired''", "''[[flaxen]]''", and "''[[towhead|towheaded]]''".

===Alternative spellings===
*[[blond]] (UK)
