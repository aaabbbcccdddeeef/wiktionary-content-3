{{en-noun|head=[[bread-and-butter]] [[note]]}}

# A short [[note]] [[thank]]ing someone who has recently provided the writer with [[hospitality]].  Generally the note is tucked under a pillow to be found as the host or hostess is changing the sheets after one's departure and is considered to be a bit of a surprise in appreciation for opening their doors and/or caring for you during your stay.  It could be left on the breakfast table if they have departed for work but would never be handed to them directly.  

In a broader sense, a Bread and Butter note could be left by a tenant if the landlord went above and beyond the terms of the lease or did some other expression that was beyond the agreed upon deal you made with them.  Even though you might have paid rent to them, they extended courtesies, changed their schedule to accommodate you or did things that were of a host or hostess nature during your tenancy.  The note would again not be mailed or delivered to them.. it would be placed in a way as to be found.
