==English==

===Etymology===
English from the mid 16th century, with the meaning of "balsamic resin".
The English term was adopted via Middle French  ''[[benjoin]]'' from either Spanish, Portuguese or Italian; c.f.  Spanish ''[[benjuí]]'', Portuguese ''[[beijoin]]'', Italian ''[[benzoi]]''.

The Romance word is a corruption of  Arabic {{term|لبان جاوي|sc=Arab|tr=lubān jāwī|lang=ar||benzoin}} "incense from Java".  The initial ''lu'' was probably lost because it was taken as the definite article in Romance.
