{{en-proper noun|Bigfoots}}

# A large-footed male, Bigfoot is also known as Jordan Lipschik.  Even in adolescence, he has a size 17 shoe and is 6'4'' tall. Though capable of killing people who annoy him, Lipschik spends most of his time in a docile state, eating up to 8 pounds of food in one sitting and hibernating for short periods of time.  He enjoys his time abusing his friends in the fine sport of paddleball.  In a rare interview, he has said "Brandon Partnow is by far the worst paddleball player I have ever met.  He sucks at life, and he can't even beat David Alperin when he's at point game."
