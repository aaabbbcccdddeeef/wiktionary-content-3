{{en-noun}}

# A flat curved [[airfoil]] originally used in various parts of the world as hunting weapons or, in returnable types, for sports or training.
#* '''1884''', [[w:Andrew Lang|Andrew Lang]], ''Star Myths'' in ''[[s:Custom and Myth/Star Myths|Custom and Myth]]'',
#*: Some resemblance to terrestrial things, it is true, everyone can behold in the heavens. ''Corona'', for example, is like a crown, or, as the Australian black fellows know, it is like a '''boomerang''', and we can understand why they give it the name of that curious curved missile.
#* '''1897''', Warren Bert Kimberly, ''[[s:History of West Australia|History of West Australia]]'',
#*: With '''boomerang''' and spear they hunted the kangaroo and emu, and fought their battles beneath the eucalyptus forests; their minds, fresh, untroubled, contented, oblivious alike of noble ideals and philosophic principles.
#* '''1961''', [[w:Charlie Drake|Charlie Drake]], song, ''My '''Boomerang''' Won't Come Back'',
#*: "Don't worry, boy, I know the trick, / And to you I'm gonna show it. / If you want your '''boomerang''' to come back, / Well first you've got to... throw it."
