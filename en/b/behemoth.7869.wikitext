===Etymology===
From {{etyl|he}} {{term|בהמות|tr=Bəhēmôth|sc=Hebr}}, the name of a creature mentioned in the Book of Job (XL.xv). It is most likely a plural form of {{term|בהמה|tr=bəhēmāh||animal|sc=Hebr}}. It may be an example of pluralis excellentiae, a Hebrew method of expressing greatness by pluralizing a noun; it thus indicates that Behemoth is the largest and most powerful animal. It is also suspected that it is derived from the ancient [[Egyptian]] name for the [[hippopotamus]], 'p-ehe-mau', which literally translates as "water ox." [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=behemoth]  The word entered into Middle English at around the 14th century from late Latin.
