===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*leǵ-}}
The English -logy suffix originates with loanwords from the Greek, usually via Latin and French, where the suffix ([[-λογία]]) is an integral part of the word loaned. E.g. {{m|en|astrology}} from {{m|la|astrologia}}, since the 16th century.

The {{der|en|fr|-logie}} is a continuation of {{der|en|la|-logia}}, ultimately from {{der|en|grc|-λογία}}. Within Greek, the suffix is an {{m|grc|-ία}} abstract from {{m|grc|λόγος|t=account, explanation, narrative}}, itself a verbal noun from {{m|grc|λέγω|t=I [[say]], [[speak]], [[converse]], tell a story}}.

Within English, the suffix becomes productive, especially to form names of sciences or departments of study, analogous to names of disciplines loaned from the Latin, such as {{m|en|astrology}} from {{m|la|astrologia}} or {{m|en|geology}} from {{m|la|geologia}}. Original compositions of terms with no precedent in Greek or Latin become common beginning in the later 18th century, sometimes imitating French or German templates (e.g. {{m|en|insectology}}, attested 1766, after French {{m|fr|insectologie}}; {{m|en|terminology}}, attested 1801, after German {{m|de|Terminologie}}).

In a third stage, from the 19th century, the suffix becomes productive enough to form [[nonce]] combinations with English terms with no Greek or Latin origin, such as {{m|en|undergroundology}} (1820), {{m|en|hatology}} (1837).

Finally, from the second half of the 19th century, the suffix has also been used as a simplex as {{m|en|ology}} (plural ''ologies'') and {{m|en|logy}} (plural ''logies''), in parallel with and often alongside {{m|en|ism}} (plural ''isms'').
