====Usage notes====
* While a terminal silent ''-e'' is usually dropped when adding a suffix beginning with a vowel, which is followed by '''-able''', the ''-e'' is ''not'' dropped when adding '''-able''' if the root ends with a soft ''-ce'' and ''-ge'', as in {{term|replaceable}} and {{term|changeable}}, so that these are not misinterpreted as hard ‘c’ or ‘g’ sounds. This same rule is used for {{term|-ous}}, as in {{term|courageous}}.
* The form {{term|-ible}} has the same senses and pronunciation. The choice between the two is somewhat idiosyncratic, but in general, {{term||-ible}} is used in forms derived from Latin verbs of the second, third, and fourth conjugations, and in a few words whose roots end in a soft ''c'' or ''g'', while {{term||-able}} is used in all other such words, particularly those formed from Latin verbs of the first conjugation and those that come from French or from Anglo-Saxon (Old English). Fowler's ''English Usage'' recommends using {{term||-ible}} for simplicity's sake in ''any'' word whose root ends in a soft ''c'' or ''g'' to avoid ''-eable'' (e.g., *{{term||changible}} rather than {{term|changeable}}), but this recommendation has generally not been followed.
* A number of adjectives in {{term||-able}} come from verbs that do not have direct objects, but that rather are construed with prepositions. In these cases, the preposition does not appear with the adjective in {{term||-able}}; hence, {{term|reliable||worthy of being [[rely|relied]] on}}, {{term|laughable||suited for [[laugh|laughing]] at}}, {{term|remarkable||fit to be [[remark|remarked]] upon}}, and so on.
* Traditionally, verbs ending in unstressed {{term|-ate}} drop this suffix before adding {{term||-able}}; hence, {{term|communicable||able to be [[communicate]]d}}, {{term|eradicable||possible to [[eradicate]]}}, and so on.
* There are cases where a word with ''[[un-]] -able'' is much common than one with just ''-able'', such as ''[[unbreakable]]'', ''[[unsinkable]]'', and ''[[untouchable]]''.
