#*'''References:''' The OED, whose entry "payable" identifies the word's etymology as "[[pay]]" + the suffix "-able" and provides the definition: "Of a sum of money, bill, tax, etc.: that is to be paid; due, owing; falling due (at or on a specified date, or to a specified person). Also fig." 

====Usage notes====
*The form ''[[-ible]]'' has the same senses and pronunciation. The choice between the two is somewhat idiosyncratic, but in general, ''-ible'' is used in forms derived from Latin verbs of the second, third, and fourth conjugations, and in a few words whose roots end in a soft ''c'' or ''g'', while ''-able'' is used in all other such words, particularly those formed from Latin verbs of the first conjugation and those that come from French or from Anglo-Saxon (Old English). Fowler's ''English Usage'' recommends using ''-ible'' for simplicity's sake in ''any'' word whose root ends in a soft ''c'' or ''g'' (e.g. ''changible'' rather than ''[[changeable]]''), but this recommendation has generally not been followed.
*A number of adjectives in ''-able'' come from verbs that do not have direct objects, but that rather are construed with prepositions. In these cases, the preposition does not appear with the adjective in ''-able''; hence, ''[[reliable]]'' ("able to be [[rely|relied]] on"), ''[[laughable]]'' ("suited for [[laugh|laughing]] at"), ''[[remarkable]]'' ("fit to be [[remark|remarked]] upon"), and so on.
