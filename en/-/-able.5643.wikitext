* Not closely related etymologically, though currently related semantically, to ''[[able]]''.
* Replaced native Old English {{m|ang|-bǣre||bearing, making, worth}}, from Proto-Germanic {{m|gem-pro|*bēriz}}, {{m|gem-pro|*bērijaz}}; and {{m|ang|-lic||like, having the quality of}}, from Proto-Germanic {{m|gem-pro|*-līkaz}}.

=====Usage notes=====
* Originally used only on French and Latin words, like [[separable]]. Over time ''-able'' was added to stems of English verbs ending in ''-ate'', such as [[educable]]. Finally, due to probable confusion with the word [[able]], it was used to form adjectives from all sorts of verbs, nouns, and even verb phrases, such as [[kickable]], [[get-at-able]], and [[clubbable]].
* While a terminal silent ''-e'' is usually dropped when adding a suffix beginning with a vowel, which is followed by '''-able''', the ''-e'' is ''not'' dropped when adding '''-able''' if the root ends with a soft ''-ce'' and ''-ge'', as in {{m|en|replaceable}} and {{m|en|changeable}}, so that these are not misinterpreted as hard ‘c’ or ‘g’ sounds. This same rule is used for {{m|en|-ous}}, as in {{m|en|courageous}}.
* As when adding the suffix {{m|en|-ed}}, a final consonant of a root should be doubled if the preceding vowel is short and (in British English) stressed.
* The form {{m|en|-ible}} has the same senses and pronunciation. The choice between the two is somewhat idiosyncratic, but in general, {{m|en||-ible}} is used in forms derived from Latin verbs of the second, third, and fourth conjugations, and in a few words whose roots end in a soft ''c'' or ''g'', while {{m|en||-able}} is used in all other such words, particularly those formed from Latin verbs of the first conjugation and those that come from French or from Anglo-Saxon (Old English). Fowler's ''English Usage'' recommends using {{m|en||-ible}} for simplicity's sake in ''any'' word whose root ends in a soft ''c'' or ''g'' to avoid ''-eable'' (e.g., {{m|en||*changible}} rather than {{m|en|changeable}}), but this recommendation has generally not been followed.
* A number of adjectives in {{m|en||-able}} come from verbs that do not have direct objects, but that rather are construed with prepositions. In these cases, the preposition does not appear with the adjective in {{m|en||-able}}; hence, {{m|en|reliable||fit to being [[rely|relied]] on}}, {{m|en|laughable||suited for [[laugh|laughing]] at}}, {{m|en|remarkable||fit to be [[remark|remarked]] upon}}, and so on.
* Traditionally, verbs ending in {{m|en|-ate}} drop this suffix before adding {{m|en||-able}}; hence, {{m|en|communicable||able to be [[communicate]]d}}, {{m|en|eradicable||possible to [[eradicate]]}}, {{m|en|implacable||unable to be [[placated]]}}, {{m|en|inimitable||unable to [[imitated]]}}, and so on, but {{m|en|relatable}}, because ''relate'' is ''re-'' + ''-late'', not ''rel-'' + ''-ate''. Logically one should therefore say ''[[rotable]]'' to mean "able to be rotated", but {{m|en|rotatable}} has become accepted.
* There are cases where a word with ''[[un-]] -able'' is much more common than one with just ''-able'', such as ''[[unbreakable]]'', ''[[unsinkable]]'', and ''[[untouchable]]''.
