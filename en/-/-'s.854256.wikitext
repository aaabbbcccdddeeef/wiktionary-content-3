=====Usage notes=====
Words ending in ''s'' are made possessive in various ways. Consider:<ref>[[w:William Strunk|William Strunk]] & [[w:E.B._White|E. B. White]], ''[[w:The_Elements_of_Style|The Elements of Style]]'' (1972), [[s:The_Elements_of_Style/Rules#1._Form_the_possessive_singular_of_nouns_with_.27s.|page 1]]</ref>
* With [[regular]] [[plurals]], the [[apostrophe]] is placed at the end, i.e. ''[[s']]'' is used:
*: ''the dog[[s’]] tails'' (whereas for [[singular]] ‘dog’: ''the dog'''[[’s]]''' tail'')
* [[irregular|Irregular]] plurals with endings other than ‘s’ (e.g. ''children'') always take '''’s''':
*: ''the children'''’s''' voices''
* The possessives of names which end in ''s'' may be formed using either this suffix (''-'s'') or ''[[']]'' (which see for more).
*: ''[[St James's|St. James'''’s''']] or St. James’'', ''Chris's'' or ''Chris&apos;'', ''Jesus's'' or ''Jesus&apos;''
* To remedy ambiguity or awkwardness in either speech or print, possessives can generally be recast using ''of''.
*: ''the tails of the dogs''
*: ''the paths of St. James''
* When referring to possessions of multiple people who don't share the same name, the standard, formal way to form the possessive is:
*: ''Jack'''’s''' and Jill'''’s''' pails''
* However, it is common to treat the pair of names as a noun phrase and to form the possessive of this instead, using only one '''’s''':
*: ''Jack and Jill'''’s''' pails''

# {{non-gloss definition|Indicates a purpose or a user.}}
#: ''You need a driver'''’s''' licence.''
#: ''These are popular boy'''’s''' T-shirts.''
#: ''Alex can be a girl'''’s''' name.''

=====Usage notes=====
{{rfc|there should be a better clarification}}
The particle ''’s'' and the suffix ''’s'' have the same origin but are grammatically different now.
* particle: ''a girl'''’s''' name'' : The name of a specific girl. The particle combines with ''a girl''.
* suffix: ''a girl'''’s''' name'' : A female name. The suffix combines with ''girl''.

===Etymology 3===
Equivalent to ''[[-s]]'', with arbitrary use of apostrophe.

====Suffix====
{{en-suffix|head=’s|cat2=inflectional suffixes}}

# {{lb|en|sometimes|_|proscribed}} Used to form the plurals of [[numeral]]s, [[letter]]s, some [[abbreviation]]s and some nouns, usually because the omission of an apostrophe would make the meaning unclear or ambiguous.
#: ''There are four 3'''’s''' in my phone number.''
#: ''“Banana” has three a'''’s''' and one b.'' (apostrophe "s" used so that the plural of “a” is not confused with the word “as”)
#: ''You can buy CD'''’s''' in that shop.''
#: ''These are the do'''’s''' and don’ts.'' (apostrophe "s" used as “dos” may be misread)
# {{context|obsolete|lang=en}} Used to form plurals of foreign words, to clarify pronunciation, such as “banana’s” or “pasta’s”.<ref name="esl">[[w:Lynn Truss|Truss, Lynn]]. ''Eats, Shoots & Leaves''. pp.&nbsp;63–65.</ref>
# {{context|proscribed|lang=en}} Used to form the plural of nouns that correctly take just an "s" in the plural. See '''[[greengrocer's apostrophe|greengrocer’s apostrophe]]'''.
#: ''Apple'''’s''' 50p a pound''

=====Usage notes=====
The use of '''''’s''''' to form plurals of initialisms or numerals is not currently recommended by most authorities, except when the meaning would otherwise be unclear. The use in foreign words was common before the 19th century, but is no longer accepted.<ref name="esl" /> The use of the apostrophe in any other plural (as in “apple’s”) &mdash; the so-called “[[greengrocer's apostrophe|greengrocer’s apostrophe]]” &mdash; is proscribed.

===Suffix===

# Used to form the plural form of nouns ending in a vowel, except schwa.
#: ''foto'' &rarr; ''foto’s'' (instead of ''fotoos'')
#: ''taxi'' &rarr; ''taxi’s'' (instead of ''taxies'')

# {{non-gloss definition|Used to form the genitive of proper names under certain circumstances.}}
#: [[Andrea#German|Andrea]] → Andrea's (''but also:'' Andreas) (to avoid confusion with the name {{m|de|Andreas}})

====Usage notes====
* The use of ''[[-'s]]'' instead of ''[[-s]]'' is allowed, according to the German spelling reform of 1996, only when bare ''[[-s]]'' would be ambiguous (as in the example above). In informal writing it is sometimes used even when there is no ambiguity (e.g. ''Peter's''), but this is proscribed.
