=====Usage notes=====
* [[irregular|Irregular]] plurals with endings other than ‘s’ (e.g. ''children'') always take '''’s''': ''the children'''’s''' voices''.
* Words ending in ''s'' are made possessive in various ways. Consider:<ref>[[w:William Strunk|William Strunk]] & [[w:E.B._White|E. B. White]], ''[[w:The_Elements_of_Style|The Elements of Style]]'' (1972), [[s:The_Elements_of_Style/Rules#1._Form_the_possessive_singular_of_nouns_with_.27s.|page 1]]</ref>
** With [[regular]] [[plurals]], the [[apostrophe]] is placed at the end, i.e. {{m|en|[[-s]][[-'|']]}} is used (''the dog{{l|en|[[-s|s]][[-'|’]]}} tails'', whereas for [[singular]] ‘dog’, ''the dog'''’s''' tail'').
** The possessives of names which end in ''s'' may be formed using either this suffix (''-'s'') or {{l|en|-'|bare ''-'''}} (which see for more). Hence: {{m|en|St James's|St. James'''’s'''}} or ''St. James’'', ''Chris's'' or ''Chris&apos;'', ''Jesus's'' or ''Jesus&apos;''. The two suffixes may or may not be distinguished in pronunciation; for example, the BBC prescribes the following distinction:<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/learnit/learnitv57.shtml Learning English: Use of the apostrophe]</ref> ''Dickens’ novel'' {{IPAchar|/dɪkɪnz nɒvəl/}} (identically to ''(a) Dickens novel''), ''Dickens’s novel'' {{IPAchar|/dɪkɪnzɪz nɒvəl/}}. Some speakers, however, may pronounce both as {{IPAchar|/ɪz/}}, i.e. ''Dickens’'' as {{IPAchar|/ˈdɪkɪnzɪz/}}.
* To remedy ambiguity or awkwardness in either speech or print, possessives can generally be recast using ''of'': ''the tails of the dogs'', ''the paths of St. James''
* When referring to possessions of multiple people who don't share the same name, the standard, formal way to form the possessive is ''Jack'''’s''' and Jill'''’s''' pails''. However, it is common to treat the pair of names as a noun phrase and to form the possessive of this instead, using only one '''’s''': ''Jack and Jill'''’s''' pails''.
* The use of ''’s'' to make nouns or noun phrases genitive that are seemingly already marked thus by {{m|en|of}} is widespread in English. It is nearly exclusively used with animate nouns. It may seem redundant, but it can clarify meaning. For example, “painting of the woman” can mean “painting that belongs to the woman” or “painting that depicts the woman”, but “painting of the woman'''’s'''” must mean “painting that belongs to the woman”. Though widespread, some speakers find it awkward and suggest it be avoided by rewriting sentences that would require it.
* Nouns that do not decline for plurality still do not when this suffix is attached, so “one moose” becomes “one moose’s” and “two moose” becomes “two moose’s”.

===Etymology 2===
Equivalent to {{m|en|-s}}, with addition of apostrophe.

====Suffix====
{{en-suffix|head=’s|cat2=inflectional suffixes}}

# {{lb|en|sometimes|_|proscribed}} Used to form the plurals of [[numeral]]s, [[letter]]s, some [[abbreviation]]s and some nouns, usually because the omission of an apostrophe would make the meaning unclear or ambiguous.
#: {{ux|en|There are four 3'''’s''' in my phone number.}}
#: {{ux|en|“Banana” has three a'''’s''' and one b. ''(apostrophe "s" used so that the plural of “a” is not confused with the word “as”)''}}
#: {{ux|en|You can buy CD'''’s''' in that shop.}}
#: {{ux|en|These are the do'''’s''' and don’ts. ''(apostrophe "s" used as “dos” may be misread)''}}
#: {{m|en|10's|10'''’s'''}}; {{m|en|100's|100'''’s'''}}; {{m|en|A+'s|A+'''’s'''}}; {{m|en|A.U.'s|A.U.'''’s'''}}; {{m|en|don't's|don’t'''’s'''}}; {{m|en|s's|s'''’s'''}}
# {{lb|en|obsolete}} Used to form plurals of foreign words, to clarify pronunciation, such as “banana’s” or “pasta’s”.<ref name="esl">[[w:Lynn Truss|Truss, Lynn]]. ''Eats, Shoots & Leaves''. pp.&nbsp;63–65.</ref>
#: {{m|en|index's|index'''’s'''}}
# {{lb|en|proscribed}} Used to form the plural of nouns that correctly take just an "s" in the plural. See [[greengrocer's apostrophe|greengrocer’s apostrophe]].
#: {{ux|en|Apple'''’s''' 50p a pound}}

=====Usage notes=====
The use of '''''’s''''' to form plurals of initialisms or numerals is not currently recommended by most authorities, except when the meaning would otherwise be unclear. The use in foreign words was common before the 19th century, but is no longer accepted.<ref name="esl" /> The use of the apostrophe in any other plural (as in “apple’s”) &mdash; the so-called “[[greengrocer's apostrophe|greengrocer’s apostrophe]]” &mdash; is proscribed.
