'''Phagy''' or '''phagia''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] or [[behavior|behavioral]] term that is used to identify particular [[nutrition]]al systems or [[feeding behavior]]s.  The [[suffix]]es '''-phagy''', '''-phagous''' and '''-phage''' are used to name different types of phagy or animals that perform it, which include:

* [[Monophagy]] &mdash; feeding on a single type of food (f.e. a single plant [[species]])
* [[Oligophagy]] &mdash; feeding on few specific types of food (f.e. a single plant [[genus]])
* [[Polyphagy]] &mdash; feeding on many kinds of food (f.e. all (or almost all) the species of a single plant [[family (biology)|family]]) 
* [[Phytophagy]] &mdash; the eating of [[plants]]
* [[Ophiophagy]] &mdash; feeding on [[snakes]]
* [[Hematophagy]] &mdash; feeding on [[blood]]
* [[Coprophagy]] &mdash; feeding on [[faeces]]
* [[Geophagy]] &mdash; feeding on [[earth]]
* [[Bacteriophagous]] &mdash; feeding on [[bacteria]]
* See [[Pica (disorder)]] for some more.

Phagy can also be used to name eating in a specified manner, normal or abnormal (for example [[dysphagia]], a dysfunction of [[deglutition]]). 

This word root can also be used as a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] in other words, such as in [[phagocytosis]] (the function of specialized [[cell (biology)|cells]] that can feed on inorganic or organic matter, including other cells).

The term comes from [[Greek language]] ''phagein'', to eat; with [[Indo-European language]] roots in ''bhag''.
