==English==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|[ɪtɪ]}}; ''but see the usage notes below''

===Etymology===
From {{OF.}} ''[[-ité]]'', in turn from {{L.}} ''[[-itas]]''.

===Suffix===
'''-ity'''

# ''Used to form a noun from an adjective; especially, to form the noun referring to the state, property, or quality of conforming to the adjective's description.''
# ''Used to form other nouns, especially abstract nouns.'' <!-- such as [[proclivity]] -->

====Usage notes====
* Many nouns formed with ''-ity'' are uncountable; those that are countable form their plurals in ''-ities''.
* The addition of ''-ity'' to an adjective results in a shift of stress to the antepenultimate syllable; that is, words in ''-ity'' are stressed on the last syllable before the ''-ity'', even in cases where this syllable is part of another suffix (as in words in ''[[-ability]]'', ''[[-ivity]]'', and ''[[-icity]]''). Further, this shift typically results in a change in vowel quality; compare, for example, ''[[real]]'' and ''[[reality]]'', where the sound {{IPAchar|[æ]}} in the second word is not present in the first. These vowel quality changes are usually consistent with the spelling of both forms — note that the letter &lt;a> in the second word ''is'' present in the first — but is pronounced {{IPAchar|[k]}}, before ''-ity'' it becomes {{IPAchar|[s]}}; compare, for example, ''[[elastic]]'' and ''[[elasticity]]''.
* Final ''-e'' is dropped before adding this suffix.
