{{also|ably}}
==English==

===Alternative forms===
* [[-ibly]]
* [[-bly]]<ref>{{R:RHCD|page=4}}</ref>

===Suffix===
{{en-suffix|cat2=adverb-forming suffixes}}

# {{non-gloss definition|Used to form [[adverb]]s corresponding to [[adjective]]s that end in [[-able]].}}
#: ''suit'''ably'''''

====Usage notes====
Generally only used to form analogs to adjectives ending in {{m|en|-able}}, replacing the existing {{m|en|-able}}. Rather than a distinct suffix, this can be considered a class of euphonic blends of {{m|en||-ble}} and {{m|en|-ly}}, as in {{m|en|feebly}}, {{m|en|nimbly}}, and {{m|en|nobly}}, among others. Compare {{m|en|-ability}}, which is more strictly an analog, originating in parallel borrowings from French, sometimes Latin.

====Derived terms====
