{{also|ably}}
==English==

===Alternative forms===
* [[-ibly]]
* [[-bly]]<ref>{{R:RHCD|page=4}}</ref>

===Suffix===
{{en-suffix|cat2=adverb-forming suffixes}}

# {{non-gloss definition|Used to form [[adverb]]s corresponding to [[adjective]]s that end in [[-able]].}}
#: ''suit'''ably'''''

====Usage notes====
Generally only used to form analogs to adjectives ending in {{term|-able|lang=en}}, replacing the existing {{term|-able|lang=en}}. Rather than a distinct suffix, this can be considered a class of euphonic blends of “-ble” and {{term|-ly|lang=en}}, as in {{term|feebly|lang=en}}, {{term|nimbly|lang=en}}, and {{term|nobly|lang=en}}, among others.
