{{also|not}}
==English==

===Suffix===
{{infl|en|suffix|head=[[n't|-nâ€™t]]|sort=nt}}

# Negates the meaning of the clause in which it occurs.

====Usage notes====
* The suffix {{term||-n't|lang=en}} can only be added to [[auxiliary verb]]s, including {{term|dare|lang=en}} and {{term|need|lang=en}} in certain uses, and {{term|be|lang=en}} in almost all uses. Indeed, in some dialects, not even all auxiliary verbs accept {{term||-n't|lang=en}}, with both {{term|mayn't|lang=en}} and {{term|amn't|lang=en}} being present in some dialects and absent in others.
* Some verbs change their spelling when {{term||-n't|lang=en}} is added (for example, ''shall'' becomes ''shan't'').
