{{also|n't|not}}
==English==

===Etymology===
Shortening of {{term|not}}

===Suffix===
{{en-suffix|head=-n’t|sort=nt}}

# {{non-gloss definition|[[negate|Negates]] the meaning of the clause in which it occurs.}}

====Usage notes====
* The suffix {{term||-n't|lang=en}} can only be added to [[auxiliary verb]]s, including {{term|dare|lang=en}} and {{term|need|lang=en}} in certain uses, and {{term|be|lang=en}} in almost all uses. Indeed, in some dialects, not even all auxiliary verbs accept {{term||-n't|lang=en}}; for example, {{term|mayn't|lang=en}} is present in some dialects and absent in others.
* Some verbs change their form when {{term||-n't|lang=en}} is added; for example, {{term|shall|lang=en}} + {{term||-n't|lang=en}} is usually {{term|shan't|lang=en}}, and {{term|am|lang=en}} + {{term||-n't|lang=en}} is frequently {{term|aren't|lang=en}} or {{term|ain't|lang=en}} (though all three of these are dialect-dependent).
* Though verbs with {{term||-n't|lang=en}} are usually considered contractions of versions using the adverb {{term|not|lang=en}}, grammatically they behave a bit differently. For example, when subject and verb are inverted, {{term||-n't|lang=en}} remains attached to the verb, whereas {{term||not|lang=en}} does not:
*: ''Is'''n't''' that difficult?''
*: ''Is that '''not''' difficult?''
* Semantically, {{term||-n't|lang=en}} may have either “high attachment” or “low attachment”, depending primarily on the verb. For example, “I can’t leave” means “It is not the case that I can leave” (usually “I am unable to leave”), whereas “I shouldn’t leave” means basically “I should stay” (which is a narrower statement, and therefore a stronger one, than “It is not the case that I should leave”). (“I can stay”, by contrast, is very different from “I can’t leave.”) Similar variation is seen with the adverb {{term||not|lang=en}}, as well as various other negative constructions.
