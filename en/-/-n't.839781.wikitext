===Suffix===
{{infl|en|suffix|head=[[n't|-nâ€™t]]|sort=nt}}

# Negates the meaning of the clause in which it occurs.

====Usage notes====
The suffix '''-n't''' can only be added to [[auxiliary verb]]s, with the exception of ''[[dare]]'' and {{term|need}}, which can take '''-n't''' despite being a lexical verb. Some verbs change their spelling when '''-n't''' is added (for example, ''shall'' becomes ''shan't'') and some verbs do not accept '''-n't''' (for example, ''may'' & ''am'' in some dialects).
