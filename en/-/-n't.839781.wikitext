====Usage notes====
* This contraction does not receive stress, even for contrast: ''either you DID or you DIDn't.''
* The suffix {{m|en||-n’t}} can only be added to [[auxiliary verb]]s, including {{m|en|dare}} and {{m|en|need}} in certain uses, as well as main verbs {{m|en|be}} (in almost all uses) and {{m|en|have}} (in some uses). Indeed, in some dialects, not even all auxiliary verbs accept {{m|en||-n’t}}; for example, {{m|en|mayn't|mayn’t}} is present in some dialects and absent in others.
* Some verbs change their form when {{m|en||-n’t}} is added; for example, {{m|en|shall}} + {{m|en||-n’t}} is usually {{m|en|shan't|shan’t}}, and {{m|en|am}} + {{m|en||-n’t}} is frequently {{m|en|aren't|aren’t}} or {{m|en|ain't|ain’t}} (though all three of these are dialect-dependent).
* Though verbs with {{m|en||-n’t}} are usually considered contractions of versions using the adverb {{m|en|not}}, grammatically they behave a bit differently. For example, when subject and verb are inverted, {{m|en||-n’t}} remains attached to the verb, whereas {{m|en||not}} does not:
*: ''Is'''n’t''' that difficult?''
*: ''Is that '''not''' difficult?''
* Semantically, {{m|en||-n’t}} may have either “high attachment” or “low attachment”, depending primarily on the verb. For example, “I can’t leave” means “It is not the case that I can leave” (usually “I am unable to leave”), whereas “I shouldn’t leave” means basically “I should stay” (which is a narrower statement, and therefore a stronger one, than “It is not the case that I should leave”). (“I can stay”, by contrast, is very different from “I can’t leave.”) Similar variation is seen with the adverb {{m|en||not}}, as well as various other negative constructions.
