===Suffix===
{{infl|en|suffix|head=-nâ€™t|sort=nt}}

# Negates the meaning of the clause in which it occurs.

====Usage notes====
* The suffix {{term||-n't|lang=en}} can only be added to [[auxiliary verb]]s, including {{term|dare|lang=en}} and {{term|need|lang=en}} in certain uses, and {{term|be|lang=en}} in almost all uses. Indeed, in some dialects, not even all auxiliary verbs accept {{term||-n't|lang=en}}; for example, {{term|mayn't|lang=en}} is present in some dialects and absent in others.
* Some verbs change their form when {{term||-n't|lang=en}} is added; for example, {{term|shall|lang=en}} + {{term||-n't|lang=en}} is usually {{term|shan't|lang=en}}, and {{term|am|lang=en}} + {{term||-n't|lang=en}} is frequently {{term|aren't|lang=en}} or {{term|ain't|lang=en}} (though all three of these are dialect-dependent).
