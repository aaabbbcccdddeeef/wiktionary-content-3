# Negates the meaning of the clause in which it occurs.

====Usage notes====
The suffix '''-n't''' can only be added to [[auxiliary verb]]s. Some verbs change their spelling when '''-n't''' is added (for example, ''shall'' becomes ''shan't'') and some verbs do not accept '''-n't''' (for example, ''may'' & ''am'').
