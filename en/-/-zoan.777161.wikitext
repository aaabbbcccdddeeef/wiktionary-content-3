==Introduction==
The suffix '''-zoan''' is used primarily as a tool in [[zoology]] to form words used for categorising animals based on their [[evolutionary origin]], [[life-history]], [[growth-form]] or [[ecological preferences]]; the main purpose of this article is to provide a single point of reference for these terms.

==Etymology==
Such words are formed from [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] roots with the terminal ''-zoan'' ("_____-zoan" basically means "_____ animal".)
