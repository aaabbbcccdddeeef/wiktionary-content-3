From the [[homographic]] [[w:Grammatical case|case]] endings of the [[nominative]], [[accusative]], and [[vocative]] forms of numerous [[Appendix:Latin second declension#Neuter|neuter]] {{etyl|la|en}} [[Appendix:Latin second declension#Neuter|second declension]] nouns.

# {{context|chemistry|lang=en}} Forms the ends of the names of certain [[element]]s (such as [[molybdenum]] and [[platinum]]).

=====Usage notes=====
* The vast majority of words which feature this suffix also have standard ''-ums'' plurals formed by suffixation with the {{term|-s|lang=en}} plural suffix. However, in such situations, the {{term||-s|lang=en}} suffix morphologically is additional to and separate from the {{term||-um|lang=en}} suffix.
