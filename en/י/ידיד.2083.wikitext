===Etymology===
Related to {{m|ar|وَدِيد||friendly, beloved}} and {{m|uga|𐎊𐎄||beloved}} (according to Even Shoshan dictionary).

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|Modern Israeli}} {{IPA|he|/jaˈdid/}}

===Noun===

# A (male) platonic [[friend]].

====Usage notes====
* While the synonym {{m|he|חָבֵר|tr=khavér}} is more common in Modern Hebrew, it is ambiguous between a platonic friend and a romantic one; {{m|he|יָדִיד}} may therefore be used to avoid this ambiguity, though the question {{l|he||חבר חבר או רק חבר?|tr=khaver khaver o rak khaver?|gloss=boyfriend-friend or just friend?}} is also used.

====Synonyms====
