==Hebrew==

===Etymology===
Apparently from {{term|יד||hand|lang=he|sc=Hebr|tr=yad}}; literally, perhaps conveying the notion of being [[hand in hand]].

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|Modern Israeli}} {{IPA|yəˈdid|yeˈdid}}

===Noun===
{{he-noun|g=m|wv=יְדִיד|f=ידידה|pl=ידידים|tr=y'díd}}

# A (male) platonic [[friend]].

====Usage notes====
* While the synonym {{term|lang=he|חבר|sc=Hebr|tr=khavér}} is more common in Modern Hebrew, it is ambiguous between a platonic friend and a romantic one; {{Hebr|יְדִיד}} is therefore often used to avoid this ambiguity.

====Synonyms====
* {{sense|friend}} {{onym|he|חבר|sc=Hebr|tr=khavér|g=m}}
