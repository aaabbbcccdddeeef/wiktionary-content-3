An athlete that has superior measurables and is drafted higher based on his physical attributes. It can also be regarded as a negative moniker, suggesting that the player is not as accomplished on the field as his physical tools would suggest.

In recent times, it has been most commonly applied to football players who put on impressive performances at the NFL combine or at pro days, showing physical talents far greater than any they have demonstrated during their college playing days. 

The most high profile of these include [[Mike Mamula]], [[John Thierry]], [[Tebucky Jones]] and Trey Junkin. <ref>.
