'''Walian''' is a term used to describe someone from Wales. A somewhat unorthodox term, it is used most by the Welsh themselves and is most useful when talking about their origins. It helps act as a singular representation, to the rather collective ‘Welsh’ and has the basis of not being concerned by gender that lends itself to ‘Welshman’ and ‘Welshwomen’ respectively. The term therefore is not as common outside the country, but has become something of an official slang within. It is most used in the context of the divide of north and south Wales, with reference to language, wealth and views of England, which has resulted the terms; North Walian and South Walian.
