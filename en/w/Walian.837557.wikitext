# Someone from [[Wales]].

====Usage notes====
A somewhat unorthodox term, it is used most by the Welsh themselves and is most useful when talking about their origins. It helps act as a singular representation, to the rather collective ‘Welsh’ and has the basis of not being concerned by gender that lends itself to ‘Welshman’ and ‘Welshwomen’ respectively.
