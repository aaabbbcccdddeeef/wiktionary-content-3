|text=The problem of romanizing Chinese place names is a difficult one. Solutions differ from language to language, and there are several so-called "systems" used even in the English-speaking world.<br>The system most widely accepted by professionals is the '''Wade–Giles''' system. One of its key advantages is that it permits the reader to check back to the original Chinese characters, since most dictionaries are arranged according to this romanization system.}}

====Usage notes====
This term is very often used attributively, as in ''Wade-Giles romanization'', ''Wade–Giles spelling'', ''Wade–Giles system'', ''Wade–Giles transcription'', ''Wade–Giles transliteration'', ''Wade–Giles version'', and so on. Some of these terms refer to the system itself; others refer to the transcriptions of specific words under this system; most can be used both ways. While the shorter form "Wade" should technically only refer to the versions of the system prior to Giles's contributions, it was in practice often used as a synonym for the final version.
