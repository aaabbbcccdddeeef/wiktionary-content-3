===Proper noun===
{{en-proper noun}}

# A [[system]], [[formerly]] [[extremely]] [[popular]], for [[transcribing]] the [[Beijing]] [[dialect]] of [[spoken]] [[Chinese]] into the [[Latin alphabet]].

====Synonyms====
* [[Wade]]

====Usage notes====
This term is very often used attributively, as in ''Wade–Giles system'', ''Wade–Giles transcription'', ''Wade–Giles transliteration'', ''Wade–Giles spelling'', ''Wade–Giles version'', and so on. Some of these terms refer to the system itself, and others, to the transcriptions of specific words under this system; however, most can be used both ways. While the shorter form "Wade" should technically only refer to the versions of the system prior to Giles's contributions, it was in practice often used as a synonym for the final version.
