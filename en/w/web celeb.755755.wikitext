==Steps to become a Webceleb==

The current state of our ever-developing technological dependency creates a bridge between privacy and availability.  In a world of location-aware technology, people are constantly more readily available. This promotes the ability to deliver content; which is a major constituent in becoming a webceleb.  Utilizing these advancements facilitates the means with which people are broadcasting themselves online.

Two prime mediums for achieving recognition as a webceleb are: handheld “Bodyware” and immobile “Roomware”.  

1) Bodyware such as: [[w:laptops | laptops]], [[w:PDAs | PDAs]], BlackBerrys, [[w:iPhone | iPhone]], [[w:wireless network interface cards| wireless network interface cards]], as well as any other handheld data communication devices- are always communicating with computer [[w:servers | servers]] and [[w:cellular frequencies | cellular frequencies]].

2) Roomware, or homeware, devices are primarily aimed at enabling similar capabilities as bodyware- minus the luxury of mobility.  These devices are employed in the comfort of your home and a few examples are: [[desktop computers]], internet connections, digital media devices ([[cameras]], [[camcorders]], [[webcams]], etc), and modems. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/15-07/local#1 | title=Dispatches from the Hyperlocal Future | author=Harvey FeldSpar | publisher=wired.com | date=[[2007-07-10]] | accessdate = 2007-09-16}}</ref>
