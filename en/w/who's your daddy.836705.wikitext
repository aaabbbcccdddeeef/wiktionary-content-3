===Etymology===
The [[BDSM]] sense predates any other usage, which arose as a [[satire]] of the BDSM sense. Could be related to funeral games amusements in Ireland where an master of ceremonies, 'Daddy', held court ordering the players to perform several acts, 'All round your Daddy, and the last man marked!". Many of these games were symbolic of reproduction, emphasising the continuation of life in the face of death. Some could have had such 'orders' etc., See Henry Morris, 'Irish Wake Games', in the Irish folklore journal Bealoideas 8:2, 123-141, 1938 or Sean O Suilleabhain, Irish Wake Amusements. Interesting theory.

===Phrase===
