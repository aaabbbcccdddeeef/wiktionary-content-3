Like the stator it consists of a laminated core which is cylindrical in shape and carries ac current across it. Slip rings are mounted on the shaft of the rotor.

-----------------------------------
Advantage of wound rotor over the squirrel caged are that external resistances can be included  (as it uses slip rings instead of split) and hence a huge starting torque can be generated.
