#* '''1898''', {{w|J. Meade Falkner}}, {{w|Moonfleet|''Moonfleet''}}, Chapter 3:
#*: At first I could not tell what this new sound was, nor '''whence''' it came, and now it seemed a little noise close by, and now a great noise in the distance. And then it grew nearer and more defined, and in a moment I knew it was the sound of voices talking.
#* {{quote-book|year=1611|title=King James Bible|section=John 8:14|url=[s:Bible (King James)/John{{!}}Wikisource]|passage=Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know '''whence''' I came, and [[whither]] I go; but ye cannot tell '''whence''' I come, and [[whither]] I go.}}

====Usage notes====
* This word is uncommon in modern usage; ''from where'' is now usually substituted (as in the example sentence: ''Where did I come from?'' or ''From where did I come?''). It is now chiefly encountered in older works, or in poetic or literary writing.
* ''From whence'' has a strong literary precedent, appearing in Shakespeare and the King James Bible as well as in the writings of numerous Victorian-era writers. In recent times, however, it has been criticized as redundant by usage commentators.
