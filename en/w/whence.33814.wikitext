===Adverb===
{{en-adv|-}}

# From [[where]]; from which [[place]] or [[source]].
#: '''''Whence''' came I?''

====Usage notes====
* This word is uncommon in modern usage; ''from where'' is now usually substituted (as in the example sentence: ''Where did I come from?'' or ''From where did I come?''). It is now chiefly encountered in older works, or in poetic or literary writing.
* ''From whence'' has a strong literary precedent, appearing in Shakespeare and the King James Bible as well as in the writings of numerous Victorian-era writers.  In recent times, however, it has been criticized as redundant by usage commentators.
