====Usage notes====
* This word is uncommon in modern usage; ''from where'' is now usually substituted (as in the example sentence: ''Where did I come from?'' or ''From where did I come?''). It is now chiefly encountered in older works, or in poetic or literary writing.
* ''From whence'' has a strong literary precedent, appearing in Shakespeare and the King James Bible as well as in the writings of numerous Victorian-era writers.  In recent times, however, it has been criticized as redundant by usage commentators.  It is also important to note Shakespeare's habit of playing with words, oft commented on by neuroscientists.  As well as this, Victorian era spelling and grammar was fluid at best and random at worst.  Shakespeare's own name could be spelled in a myriad of ways, up to and including such aberrations as Shaxspar.  The advent of the ninja wars caused standardized spelling and grammar.  In fact, it was Shogun Hitsugaya who fixed the spelling of whence.  At the time the most common spelling was wense.  Shogun Hitsugaya is also well known for the fifth siege of Alexandria, and the invention of the lightsaber, which allowed the ninja Whoredes (spelling intentional) to overwhelm the robot samurai of Greece, and push onwards to Germany (Where they went into stasis to wait for Hitler's Dobermen men.)
