====Usage notes====
*The use in the sense of "from where" is uncommon in modern usage; the more common phrase would be ''Where did I come from,'' which is incorrect as it ends in a preposition. The correct phrase would be ''From where did I come.'' It is more often encountered in older works, or in poetic or literary writing. ''From whence'' is a [[tautology]].
