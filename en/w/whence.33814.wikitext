# From [[where]]; from which [[place]] or [[source]].
#: '''''Whence''' came I?''
#* '''1818''', {{w|Mary Shelley}}, {{w|Frankenstein|''Frankenstein''}}, Chapter 4:
#*: '''Whence''', I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
#* '''1898''', {{w|J. Meade Falkner}}, {{w|Moonfleet|''Moonfleet''}}, Chapter 3:
#*: At first I could not tell what this new sound was, nor '''whence''' it came, and now it seemed a little noise close by, and now a great noise in the distance. And then it grew nearer and more defined, and in a moment I knew it was the sound of voices talking.

====Usage notes====
* This word is uncommon in modern usage; ''from where'' is now usually substituted (as in the example sentence: ''Where did I come from?'' or ''From where did I come?''). It is now chiefly encountered in older works, or in poetic or literary writing.
* ''From whence'' has a strong literary precedent, appearing in Shakespeare and the King James Bible as well as in the writings of numerous Victorian-era writers. In recent times, however, it has been criticized as redundant by usage commentators.
