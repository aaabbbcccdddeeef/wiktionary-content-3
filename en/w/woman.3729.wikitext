===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*mon-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|woman}}, from earlier {{m|enm|wimman}}, {{m|enm|wifman}}. The Middle English forms are from {{inh|en|ang|wiman}}, {{m|ang|wimman}}, from {{m|ang|wīfmann||woman; female servant|lit=female person|g=m}}, a compound of {{com|ang|nocat=1|wīf|pos1=whence {{cog|en|wife}}|pos2=whence {{cog|en|man}}|t1=woman|mann|t2=person}}. For details on the pronunciation and spelling history, see the usage notes below.

Cognate with {{cog|sco|woman}}, {{m|sco|weman}}. Compare {{cog|stq|Wieuwmoanske||female person; female human}}. Similar constructions can be found in {{noncog|fy|frommes||woman, girl}} (from {{m|fy|frou}} and {{m|fy|minske}}, literally "woman human").

A few alternative spellings (see below) respell the term so as not to contain ''man''.

====Usage notes====
The current pronunciation of the first vowel of the singular began to appear in western England in the 13th century under the rounding influence of the ''w'', <!--with ''woman'' becoming the regular spelling by 1400, -->though the older pronunciation with {{IPAchar|/i/}} (→ modern {{IPAchar|/ɪ/}}) remained in use into the 15th century. Although the vowel of the plural was sometimes also altered to {{IPAchar|/u/}} (→ modern {{IPAchar|/ʊ/}})  beginning in the 14th century, the pronunciation with {{IPAchar|/ɪ/}} ultimately won out there, possibly under the influence of pairs like ''foot''-''feet''. However, many speakers (especially of {{w|New Zealand English}} or {{w|South African English}}) have either retained or reinnovated the pronunciation of the plural with {{IPAchar|/ʊ/}}. The modern spelling ''women'' for the plural is due to influence of the singular; it is attested from the 15th century.

For a time in the 16th and 17th centuries, the pronunciation of the singular sometimes drifted even further back towards {{IPAchar|/uː/}} or {{IPAchar|/ɔː~oː/}} (→ modern {{IPAchar|/oʊ~əʊ/}}) and the plural sometimes drifted even further forward towards {{IPAchar|/iː/}}, leading to comparisons of the words to "woe man" or "we men".)<ref>Eric John Dobson, ''English Pronunciation'', volume 2 (1957), page 574</ref><ref>{{R:Etymonline}} / {{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{R:Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref><ref name="Upward-Davidson">Christopher Upward, George Davidson, ''The History of English Spelling'' (2011), section "O"</ref>
