#* '''1988''', T. G. Pickering ''et al.'', "How common is '''white coat hypertension'''?", ''Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)'', 8 Jan.,
#*: Patients with '''white coat hypertension''' did not show a generalized increase of blood pressure lability, nor an exaggerated pressor response while at work. . . . In such patients, the pressor response may be relatively specific to the physician's office and lead to significant misclassification of hypertension.
