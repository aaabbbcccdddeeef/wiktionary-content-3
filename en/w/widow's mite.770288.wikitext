From the Bible account of the poor widow’s donation of two {{l|en|mite|mites}} (or [[lepton]]s, small coins of low value) to the temple contribution box, which [[Jesus Christ]] praised as more than the gifts presented by wealthy people, for “[a]ll these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on”: [[Luke]] 21:1–4 (''{{w|New International Version}}''); see also [[Mark]] 12:38–44.
