====Usage Note====
"Witnesseth", normally in all capitals as: "WITNESSETH", in a mistake harkening back to legal formbooks of the middle 20th century, is generally misused at the head of modern contracts, wherein it is usually used as an imperative instead of an indicative. In order to correct the usage in such cases, "WITNESSETH" should appear as part of a sentence wherein it is preceded by the words: "this agreement", or "this contract".
