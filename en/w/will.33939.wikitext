=====Usage notes=====
* Historically, '''will''' was used in the simple future sense only in the second and third person, while ''shall'' was used in the first person. Today, that distinction is almost entirely lost, and the verb takes the same form in all persons and both numbers. Similarly, in the intent sense, '''will''' was historically used with the second and third person, while ''shall'' was reserved for the first person.
* The present tense is '''will''' and the past tense is '''[[would]]'''. Early Modern English had a past participle '''[[would]]''' which is now obsolete.
*: Malory: ‘Many tymes he myghte haue had her and he had wold’. John Done: ‘If hee had would, hee might easily [...] occupied the Monarchy.’
* Formerly, '''will''' could be used elliptically for "will go" &mdash; e.g. "I'll to her lodgings" (Marlowe).
* See the usage note at '''[[shall]]'''.
* The present participle does not apply to the uses of '''will''' as an auxiliary verb.
* The form of '''will''' with the enclitic {{m|en|-n’t}} (or the present tense negative form of ''will'' in the analysis in which {{m|en|-n’t}} is an inflectional suffix) is {{m|en|won’t||will not}} (rather than the form that would be expected based on a regular application of ''-n't'', {{m|en|willn’t}}), while the corresponding form of the past tense ''would'' is {{m|en|wouldn’t}}.

#* {{Q|en|John Skorupski|, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|, Mill, John Stuart (1806–73)|year=1998|quote=Thus Mill’s case for the claim that happiness is the sole human end, put more carefully, is this: ‘Whatever is desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately to happiness, is desired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired for itself until has become so’ (1861a: 237). Nothing here assumed Hume’s view that every action must ultimately flow from an underived desire. That is a quite separate issue, and Mill’s view of it is closer to that of Kant or Reid than to that of Hume. He insists ‘positively and emphatically’ that ''the '''will''' is a different thing from desire''; that a person of confirmed virtue, or any other person whose ''purposes are fixed'', carries out his purposes without any thought of the pleasure he has in contemplating them, or expects to derive from their fulfilment. (1861a: 238) ''This distinction between purpose and desire is central to Mill’s conception of the '''will'''. When we develop purposes we can will against mere likings or aversions'': ‘In the case of an habitual purpose, instead of willing the thing because we desire it, we often desire it only because we will it’ (1861a: 238). Every action is caused by a motive, but not every motive is a liking or aversion: When the will is said to be determined by motives, a motive does not mean always, or solely, the anticipation of a pleasure or of a pain…. ''A habit of willing is commonly called a purpose''; and among the causes of our volitions, and of the actions which flow from them, must be reckoned not only likings and aversions, but also purposes. (1843: 842) ''The formation of purposes from desires is the evolution of '''will'''; it is also the development of character''. Mill quotes Novalis: ‘a character is a completely fashioned will’ (1843: 843).}}
