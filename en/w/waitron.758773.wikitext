==English==

===Etymology 1===
Coined as a gender-neutral substitute for ''[[waiter]]'' and ''[[waitress]]'', this is one of the few words with the gender-neutral suffix {{m|en|-ron}}<ref name="McFedries">Paul McFedries, ''Word Spy: The Word Lover's Guide to Modern Culture'' (2004, {{ISBN|076791807X}})</ref> to have seen much use, probably re-inforced by rhyming with {{m|en|patron}}.<ref name="McFedries"/><ref name="MWO">{{R:MWO}}</ref> (Some references instead analyse it as using the same "machinelike" suffix ''-tron''<ref name="MWO"/> as {{m|en|waitron||mechanical waiter}}, but more likely it uses {{m|en|-ron}} like ''[[Citations:laundron|laundron]]''<ref name="McFedries"/> and like {{m|en|waiter}} and {{m|en|waitress}} use {{m|en|-er}}/{{m|en|-ress}} not {{m|en||*-ter}}/{{m|en||*-tress}}.)
