===Etymology===
{{rfe|Possibly related to [[patron]].}}
First used in the 1980s at the restaurant Jo Federico's in Eugene, Oregon.  JD Beltran, a young waitress working there at the time, had become tired of introducing herself as a waitress and wanted to use a gender-neutral term.  She also had observed that customers were sometimes rude, treating the waitstaff as automatons.  One night, she asked fellow waitstaff (including Jerry Seljan, who a decade later purchased the restaurant) to begin introducing themselves with, "Hello, I'm ___ and I'll be your waitron tonight."  The term quickly took off in Eugene, as a year later while dining at a nearby restaurant, the person serving her introduced himself as her waitron. Several years later, the term also was introduced in a Time Magazine article on new words.  In 2003, it was included in the title of a New York Times book review by Michi Kakutani, "BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Why Your Waitron Can Serve Brunch but Not Linner."

 |passage=Earlier this year, at a well-known restaurant in South Africa, I saw on the menu the words "if you want something not on the menu, please consult your '''waitron'''". When I asked the manager what this meant, she told me that the term was used to ensure that no sexism was involved.}}
