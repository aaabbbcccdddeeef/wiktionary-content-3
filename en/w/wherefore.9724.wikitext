{{en-adv|-}}

# {{context|conjunctive|archaic}} [[why|Why]], for what reason, because of what.

#*: '''Wherefore''' do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?

#*: Romeo, O Romeo. '''Wherefore''' art thou, Romeo?
# {{context|conjunctive|archaic|or|formal}} [[therefore|Therefore]].

====Usage notes====
*A common misconception is that "wherefore" means "where"; it has even been used in that sense in cartoon depictions of Romeo and Juliet. In ''Romeo and Juliet'', the meaning of "Wherefore art thou, Romeo?" is not "Where are you, Romeo?" but "Why are you Romeo?" (i.e. "Why did you have to be a Montague?").
