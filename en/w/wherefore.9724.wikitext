===Usage Note===

It is a common misconception that "wherefore" means "where", and has even been used in that sense in cartoon depictions of Romeo and Juliet. In Romeo and Juliet, the context of "Wherefore art thou, Romeo?" is not "Where are you, Romeo, my love?", as is depicted. Rather, it is "Why is your name Romeo?".
