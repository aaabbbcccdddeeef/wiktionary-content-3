====Usage notes====
* A common misconception is that '''wherefore''' means ''where''; it has even been used in that sense in cartoon depictions of Romeo and Juliet, often played for comedic effect. In ''Romeo and Juliet'', the meaning of “Wherefore art thou Romeo?” ([[s:Romeo and Juliet#SCENE II. Capulet.27s orchard.|Act 2, scene 2, line 33]]) is not “''Where'' are you, Romeo?” but “''Why'' are you Romeo?” (i.e. “Why did you have to be a Montague?”).<ref>{{R:Phrase Finder|262200|O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?}}</ref>
