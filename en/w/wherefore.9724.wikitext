===Adverb===
{{en-adv|-}}

# {{archaic}} [[why|Why]], for what reason, because of what.
#*"Job", ''Holy Bible'' [[King James Version]], 21:7:
#*:'''Wherefore''' do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
#*'''1595''', [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], ''[[w:Romeo and Juliet|romeo and Juliet]]''
#*:Romeo, O Romeo. '''Wherefore''' art thou, Romeo?

====Usage notes====
* Compare: [[therefore]]
A common misconception is that "wherefore" means "where"; it has even been used in that sense in cartoon depictions of Romeo and Juliet. In ''Romeo and Juliet'', the context of "Wherefore art thou, Romeo?" is not "Where are you, Romeo?", as is depicted. Rather, it is "Why is your name Romeo?" or "Why do you exist as Romeo?".
