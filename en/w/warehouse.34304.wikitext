===Noun===
'''warehouse''' (''plural:'' [[warehouses]])

# A place for [[store|storing]] large amounts of [[product]]s (wares). In [[logistics]], a place where products go to from the [[manufacturer]] before going to the [[retailer]]

Note: With e-business trends in value chain deconstruction (Jelassi & Enders, 2005), it is also quite feasible for the retailer to have his own warehouses where inventory is stored. Also, with trends toward "cross-docking" as a means of creating efficiencies in supply chain logistics, businesses may move a lot of wares, but not necessarily need warehouses to do it (Jelassi & Enders, 2005, p. 103).
