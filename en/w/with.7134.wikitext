===Etymology===
From Old English ''[[wiþ]]'', a shortened form of ''wiþer'', from Old High German ''withar'', ''widar'' (''against'').  From Proto-Germanic ''withr'', ''against'', from Proto-Indo-European ''*wi-tero-'', literally ''more apart''; from ''wi'', ''separation''.  In Middle English, the word shifted to denote association rather than opposition.
