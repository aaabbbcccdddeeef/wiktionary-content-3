{{also|wiþ|wið|with-|wiþ-|wįð}}
==English==

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|with}}, from {{inh|en|ang|wiþ|t=against, opposite, toward, with}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*wiþi}}, a shortened form of {{der|en|gem-pro|*wiþrą|t=against}}. In Middle English, the word shifted to denote association rather than opposition, displacing {{cog|enm|mid|t=with}}, from {{cog|ang|mid|t=with}}, from {{cog|gem-pro|*midi}}; an earlier model of this meaning shift exists in cognate {{der|en|non|við}}; elsewhere, the converse meaning shift is exposed by {{cog|sem-srb|-}} {{m|inm|𐩨𐩺𐩬|t=between, amid}} spawning {{cog|sem-srb|-}} {{m|inm|𐩨𐩬|t=against}} and even likewise frequent reverse meaning {{m|inm|𐩨𐩬|t=from}}.
