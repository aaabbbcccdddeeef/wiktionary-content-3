====Usage Note====
The use of ''war'' in the rhetorical sense can lead to possibly dangerous changes in attitude. [[Crime]] is normally controlled by using [[civilian]] forces&mdash;the [[police]]&mdash;in a restrained manner, with minimal effect on uninvolved parties. True war is waged by using unrestricted [[lethal force]] on an [[enemy]], ideally without deliberate attack on uninvolved [[civilian]] parties, but with their safety secondary to defeating enemy forces. If a campaign against some form of crime is described verbally as a war, the use of [[weapon]]s and [[tactics]] totally inappropriate for fighting crime, and harm to innocent parties, becomes more acceptable.
