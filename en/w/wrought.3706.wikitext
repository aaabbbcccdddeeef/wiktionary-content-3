====Usage notes====
* In modern English, {{term|wrought|lang=en}} is usually not interchangeable with {{term|worked|lang=en}}, the more common contemporary past and past participle of {{term|work|lang=en}}. 
* Wrought often lends a more archaic flavor.<!--** It apparently is not often used in phrasal verbs derived from {{term|work#Derived terms|work}}.--><!--Hypothesis; needs testing/evidence--> It is rarely used with intransitive senses of ''work''.
* Because the phrase "work havoc" has become uncommon in modern English, its past tense "wrought havoc" is sometimes misinterpreted as being a past tense of "wreak havoc".<!--Such reinterpretation is etymologically groundless.-->

====Derived terms====
* [[overwrought]]
