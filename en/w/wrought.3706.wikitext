|passage=Floods in northern India, mostly in the small state of Uttarakhand, have '''wrought''' disaster on an enormous scale. The early, intense onset of the monsoon on June 14th swelled rivers, washing away roads, bridges, hotels and even whole villages. Rock-filled torrents smashed vehicles and homes, burying victims under rubble and sludge.}}

====Usage notes====
* In modern English, {{term|wrought|lang=en}} is usually not interchangeable with {{term|worked|lang=en}}, the more common contemporary past and past participle of {{term|work|lang=en}}.
* Wrought often lends a more archaic flavor.<!--** It apparently is not often used in phrasal verbs derived from {{term|work#Derived terms|work}}.-->
* The separation of ''wrought'' from ''work'' has also occurred because while ''work'' can be either intransitive or transitive, it is more commonly intransitive, and ''wrought'' is transitive only.<!--Hypothesis; needs testing/evidence-->
* Because the phrase "work havoc" has become uncommon in modern English, its past tense "wrought havoc" is sometimes misinterpreted as being a past tense of "{{term|wreak havoc|lang=en}}".<!--Such reinterpretation is etymologically groundless.-->

====Derived terms====
* [[overwrought]]
