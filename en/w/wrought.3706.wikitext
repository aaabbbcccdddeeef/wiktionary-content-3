|passage=Floods in northern India, mostly in the small state of Uttarakhand, have '''wrought''' disaster on an enormous scale. The early, intense onset of the monsoon on June 14th swelled rivers, washing away roads, bridges, hotels and even whole villages. Rock-filled torrents smashed vehicles and homes, burying victims under rubble and sludge.}}

====Usage notes====
* In contemporary English, {{m|en|wrought}} is usually not interchangeable with {{m|en|worked}}, the more common past and past participle of {{m|en|work}}.
* While ''wrought'' usually lends a more archaic flavor,<!--** It apparently is not often used in phrasal verbs derived from {{m|en|work#Derived terms|work}}.--> it is still fairly common in certain transitive constructions, e.g. in ''to work'' {{m|en|miracle|miracles}}.
* Because the phrase "''work havoc''" has become uncommon, its past tense "''wrought havoc''" is now sometimes misinterpreted as being a past tense of "{{m|en|wreak havoc}}".<!--Such reinterpretation is etymologically groundless.-->

====Derived terms====
* {{l|en|bewrought}}
* {{l|en|forewrought}}
* {{l|en|forwrought}}
* {{l|en|miswrought}}
* {{l|en|overwrought}}
* {{l|en|underwrought}}
* {{l|en|unwrought}}
