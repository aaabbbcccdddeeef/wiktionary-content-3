|passage=Floods in northern India, mostly in the small state of Uttarakhand, have '''wrought''' disaster on an enormous scale. The early, intense onset of the monsoon on June 14th swelled rivers, washing away roads, bridges, hotels and even whole villages. Rock-filled torrents smashed vehicles and homes, burying victims under rubble and sludge.}}
# ''(see usage notes)'' {{en-past of|wreak}}
#* '''2008''', ''The Parliamentary Debates : House of Lords official report'', p. 85:
#*: We are, however, in danger of ignoring the more fundamental lessons, forgetting the imperative to root out and to curb within our societies at every level—most importantly that of the individual—the greed, avarice, corruption and hubris which has '''wrought''' and will wreak so much havoc, not just in our relatively rich countries, but has its impact most unfairly on the poorer, unsophisticated countries.

====Usage notes====
* In contemporary English, {{m|en|wrought}} is usually not interchangeable with {{m|en|worked}}, the more common past and past participle of {{m|en|work}}.
* While ''wrought'' usually lends a more archaic flavor,<!--** It apparently is not often used in phrasal verbs derived from {{m|en|work#Derived terms|work}}.--> it is still fairly common in certain transitive constructions, e.g. in ''to work'' {{m|en|miracle|miracles}}.
* Because the phrase “work havoc” has become uncommon, its past tense “wrought havoc” is now sometimes misinterpreted as being a past tense of “{{m|en|wreak havoc}}”.<!--Such reinterpretation is etymologically groundless.-->

====Derived terms====
* {{l|en|bewrought}}
* {{l|en|forewrought}}
* {{l|en|forwrought}}
* {{l|en|inwrought}}
* {{l|en|miswrought}}
* {{l|en|overwrought}}
* {{l|en|underwrought}}
* {{l|en|unwrought}}
