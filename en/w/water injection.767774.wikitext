# {{lb|en|automotive|aviation}} The process of [[squirt]]ing a small amount of water, in the form of a [[fine]] [[spray]], into the air/fuel mixture going into a [[gasoline]] [[piston]] [[engine]], in order to cool the engine [[cylinders]], and, thereby, reduce [[detonation]] or [[knocking]] in high performance engines, especially when using a high [[compression ratio]].
# {{lb|en|aviation}} The process of [[squirt]]ing [[water]] into the [[combustion chamber]] of a [[jet engine]] to allow it to produce greater [[thrust]], partly from the production of high-pressure [[steam]] and partly from the [[cooling]] effect of the water allowing the engine to burn a greater quantity of [[fuel]] without [[overheat]]ing.
