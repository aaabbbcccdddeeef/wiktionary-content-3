=====Usage notes=====
* The form “wound” in the past is occasionally found in reference to blowing a horn, but is often considered to be erroneous. The October 1875 issue of ''The Galaxy'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NS8ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA556 disparaged this usage] as a “very ridiculous mistake” arising from a misunderstanding of the word's meaning.
* A similar solecism occurs in the use (in this sense) of the pronunciation {{IPAchar|/waɪnd/}}, sometimes heard in singing and oral reading of verse  e.g. The huntsman {{IPAchar|/waɪndz/}} his horn.
