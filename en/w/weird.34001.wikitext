====Usage notes====
o  The first usage has often been applied to [[witches]] and to [[witchcraft]] in general.

o  The second usage may have arisen by people misunderstanding the reference to the "weird sisters" ([[witches]])in Shakespeare's play Macbeth {{fact}}.

o  The third usage is often applied to people who "don't fit in" -- for example "longhairs"
(like the Beattles(!)) or more specifically people who are either [[consciously]] or [[unconsciously]] on the [[fringe]] of society, e.g., "those dirty hippies" in the 1950's.

o  The fourth usage is a strong [[perjorative]] when issued by any [[respectable]] [[member]] of [[polite]] [[society]], who is usually a member of the [[dominant]] [[class]] in that society.
[[Upper|upper]] class [[people]] who refer to [[lower]] class people in such a [[manner]] are
[[committing]] an act of [[classism]], a [[subtle]] [[twist]] on the practice of [[racism]].

o  The fifth usage, usually in the form "[[Really|really]] weird", is considered a very severe condemnation of the person about who is called by that name.
   See [[weirdo]].
