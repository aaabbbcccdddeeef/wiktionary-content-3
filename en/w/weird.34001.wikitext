* The third usage is often applied to people who "don’t fit in" &mdash; for example "[[longhairs]]"
(such as the [[Beatles]]), or more specifically people who are either [[consciously]] or [[unconsciously]] on the [[fringe]] of [[society]], e.g., "those crazy [[beatniks]]" during the 1940’s and 50’s, or "those dirty [[hippies]]" in the 1960’s and early 70’s.
* The fourth usage is a strong [[pejorative]] when issued by a respectable member of polite society, who is usually a member of the dominant class in that society.
* The fifth usage, usually in the form "[[really]] weird", is considered a severe condemnation of the person being referred to.
