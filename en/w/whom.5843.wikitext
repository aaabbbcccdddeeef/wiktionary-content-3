You have the nerve, the – the –” I saw she needed helping out. “Audacity,” I said, throwing her the line. “The audacity to dictate to me who I shall have in my house.” It should have been “'''whom'''”, but I let it go. “You have the –” “Crust.” “– the immortal rind,” she amended, and I had to admit it was stronger, “to tell me '''whom'''” – she got it right that time – “I may entertain at Brinkley Court and who” – wrong again – “I may not.”}}

====Usage notes====
''whom'' is only used as an object, whereas ''who'' is always used where a subject is required.  In other words, ''whom'' may be thought of as being similar to ''us'', ''them'', etc, whereas ''who'' may be thought of as being similar to ''we'', ''they'', etc.

However, in both spoken and most written language, ''who'' is also often used as an object in place of ''whom''. This makes ''who'' similar to ''you'' and ''it'' which also use the same form for subjects and objects.

Some [[prescriptivist]]s regard such usage as incorrect, and insist on using ''whom'' to maintain a distinction between subjects and objects.  This makes the distinction between ''who'' and ''whom'' comparable to the distinction between ''we'' and ''us'', or between ''they'' and ''them''.

To some speakers (especially in US English), the use of ''whom'' is characteristic of a formal style.  To some of these speakers, ''whom'' may sound [[stilted]] in informal conversation. ''Whom'' is more common in UK English, particularly after a [[preposition]] (''with whom'', ''from whom'', etc).
