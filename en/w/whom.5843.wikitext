===Pronoun===
The objective case of [[who]]. 

'''Usage note''': In both written and spoken language, ''who'' is often used in place of ''whom'', even as an object, although some prescriptivists regard such usage as incorrect. In US English, the use of ''whom'' is characteristic of a formal style and is often considered stilted in informal conversation. Usage of ''whom'' is more common in UK English, particularly after a [[preposition]] (''with whom'', ''from whom'' etc).
