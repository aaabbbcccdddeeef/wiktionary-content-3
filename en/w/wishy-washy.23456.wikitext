===Etymology===
{{rfe|needs revision/simplification, at the least}}
Probably a descendant from German: [[wischi waschi]], [[wischi-waschi]], [[wischiwaschi]] (colloquial), i.e. [[wishy-washy]], [[uncertain]] or [[foggy]]; [[unclear]], [[nebulous]], [[pale]] in the sense of a [[contourless]], [[clourless]], or [[dyed out]] picture, [[blurred]]; lacking [[commitment]], quickly-done, highly [[superficial]], [[unshaped]], [[untrustworthy]], [[unreliable]], [[preliminary]]; similar to “[[faded]]” without implying a process of loss; , [[dull]], vastly lacking [[depth]] and [[detail]], arbitarily [[oversimplified]] in an unorganized way, without [[understanding]]. Mainly used on matters of talk and presentation. Builds on German [[Wischen]], i.e. [[whisk]] (away), [[wipe]] (out), [[clean]], and on German [[Waschen]], i.e. [[wash]] (away), [[purify]], [[cleanse]] (out), [[launder]], both contrasting the idea of “painting a sharp picture”. The alliteration combined with baby-language elements gives a strong sense of [[clueless]] oversimplification.
