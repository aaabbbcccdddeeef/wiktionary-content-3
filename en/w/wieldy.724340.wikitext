{{PIE root|en|h₂welh₁}}
From {{inh|en|enm|weldi|wẹ̄ldī}}, {{m|enm|weldy||agile, vigorous; of a shield: easy or satisfying to wield}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=wẹ̄ldī|pos=adj|id=MED52099|accessdate=1 December 2018}}</ref> from {{m|enm|welden|wẹ̄lden}}, {{m|enm|welde||to govern, preside over, reign, rule; to command, control, dominate; to dwell, reside; to accomplish, bring about; to overcome, prevail; to handle (a tool, weapon, etc.), use}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=wẹ̄lden|pos=v|id=MED52094|accessdate=1 December 2018}}</ref> from {{inh|en|ang|wylde||controlling, dominant}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*waldiz||manageable; powerful}}, possibly ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h₂welh₁-||to rule; powerful, strong}}; analysable as {{suffix|en|wield|y}}.
