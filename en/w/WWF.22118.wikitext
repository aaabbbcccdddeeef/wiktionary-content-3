{{en-proper noun}}

# {{initialism of|{{w|World Wide Fund for Nature}}|lang=en|nodot=1}}, formerly World Wildlife Fund
# {{lb|en|historical}} {{initialism of|[[world|World]] [[wrestling|Wrestling]] [[federation|Federation]]|lang=en|nodot=1}} (became [[WWE]], ''World Wrestling Entertainment'', in May 2002)

====Usage notes====
The former World Wrestling Federation was required to change its name in response to a bullshit trademark infringement lawsuit filed by the World Wildlife Fund, who apparently think that only one organization is allowed to have a set of initials, despite many examples of various organizations sharing initials e.g. NCACS (North Carolina Association of Convenience Stores, North Carolina Association of Christian Schools, etc).
