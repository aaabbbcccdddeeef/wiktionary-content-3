====Usage notes====
* Traditional grammar classifies senses 2 and 3 as ''whether'' heading a noun clause, but classifies sense 4 as ''whether'' heading an adverbial clause.
* There is some overlap in usage between senses 2 and 3, in that a yes-or-no interrogative content clause can list the two possibilities explicitly in a number of ways:
: ''Do you know whether he’s coming or staying?''
: ''Do you know whether he’s coming or not?''
: ''Do you know whether or not he’s coming?''
: Further, in the first two of these examples, the “or staying” and “or not” may be added as an afterthought (sometimes indicated in writing with a comma before), such that the ''whether'' may be uttered in sense 3 and then amended to sense 2.
* The ''or not'' can be placed after ''whether'' or after the verb, although in senses 2 and 3, ''or not'' is not required.
* Sense 4 does not have a counterpart that introduces only a single possibility and thus requires ''or not'' if no other possibilities are presented. For example,
“He’s coming, whether you like it” is ungrammatical. Grammatical versions are “He’s coming, whether you like it or not” or “He’s coming, whether you like it or dislike it”.
* The main verb in adverbial clauses with ''whether'' is sometimes in the [[subjunctive]] mood, especially if the verb is ''be'':
: ''I shall be glad to play any instrument, whether it be a violin or a trumpet.''
