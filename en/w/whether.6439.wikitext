====Usage notes====
* There is some overlap in usage between senses 2 and 3, in that a yes-or-no interrogative content clause can list the two possibilities explicitly in a number of ways: <dl><dd>''Do you know whether he's coming or staying?''</dd><dd>''Do you know whether he's coming or not?''</dd><dd>''Do you know whether or not he's coming?''</dd></dl> Further, in the first two of these examples, the "or staying" and "or not" may be added as an afterthought (sometimes indicated in writing with a comma before), such that the ''whether'' may be uttered in sense 3 and then amended to sense 2.
* Sense 4 does not have a counterpart that introduces only a single possibility; *"He's coming, whether you like it" is ungrammatical.
* In traditional grammar, the clauses headed by ''whether'' in senses 2 and 3 are classified as noun clauses, and those headed by ''whether'' in sense 4 are classified as adverb clauses.
