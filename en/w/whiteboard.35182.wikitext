# A large vertical writing area, finished with a hard white material, which can be written upon using special markers and subsequently erased.
#* '''1995''', Gary Wolf, "The Curse of Xanadu", [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu.html?pg=15&topic= Wired Magazine]
#*: Mark Miller gave himself up to Xanadu's pull and rejoined the project full time. The new Xanadu site on Palo Alto's California Avenue was remodeled to resemble the environment at Xerox PARC. The programmers' offices opened onto a large common space, and the walls were covered with '''white board''', which quickly became a tangle of multicolored lines, words, circles, and squiggles.
