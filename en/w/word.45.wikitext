=====Usage notes=====
In English and other languages with a tradition of space-delimited writing, it is customary to treat "word" as referring to any sequence of characters delimited by spaces. However, this is not applicable to languages such as {{l|en|[[Chinese]] and [[Japanese]], which are normally written without spaces, or to languages such as [[Vietnamese]], which are written with spaces delimiting [[syllable]]s}}.

In computing, the size (length) of a word, while being fixed in a particular machine or processor family design, can be different in different designs, for many reasons. See {{w|Word (computing)}} for a full [[explanation]].
