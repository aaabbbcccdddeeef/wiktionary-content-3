=====Usage notes=====
In English and other languages with a tradition of space-delimited writing, it is customary to treat "word" as referring to any sequence of characters delimited by spaces. However, this is not applicable to languages such as [[Chinese]] and [[Japanese]], which are normally written without spaces, or to languages such as [[Vietnamese]], which are written with a space between each [[syllable]].

In computing, the size (length) of a word, while being fixed in a particular machine or processor family design, can be different in different designs, for many reasons. See {{w|Word (computing)}} for a full [[explanation]].

==Afrikaans==

===Etymology===
From {{inh|af|nl|worden}}, from {{inh|af|dum|werden}}, from {{inh|af|odt|werthan}}, from {{inh|af|gem-pro|*werþaną}}.

===Verb===
{{af-verb}}

# {{non-gloss definition|Indicates that something is in a changing state}}
#: {{ux|af|Ek het ryk '''geword'''.|t=I '''became''' rich.}}
#: {{ux|af|Ek '''word''' ryk.|t=I '''am becoming''' rich.}}
#: {{ux|af|Sy '''word''' beter.|t=She '''is getting''' better.}}
# {{non-gloss definition|Forms the present passive voice when followed by a past participle}}
#: {{ux|af|Die kat '''word''' gevoer.|t=The cat '''is being''' fed.}}

====Usage notes====
* The verb has a dated or archaic preterite '''''{{l|af|werd}}''':'' ''Die kat <u>werd</u> gevoer.'' (“The cat <u>was</u> fed.”) In contemporary Afrikaans the perfect is virtually invariably used instead: ''Die kat <u>is</u> gevoer.''
