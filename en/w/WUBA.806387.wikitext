'''WUBA''' is a multi-purpose acronym used by midshipmen at the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]].  The acronym was originally created by the Academy to define "Working Uniform, Blue Alpha," or the everyday academic attire of midshipmen.  WUBA has since evolved into a derogatory term used to describe female midshipman since the inception of women into the [[Brigade of Midshipmen]] in [[1977]].  Its use has become an issue of great controversy at the Academy and has contributed to cases of [[sexual harassment]].  

==Other Uses==
Of recent history, WUBA, amongst some weather afficianados, stands also for Weather Undergound Bloggers Anonymous, created in 2005 by a blogger known as SWFLsurvivor, or WUBAmama.  It was created right after [[Hurricane Katrina]] devastated the United States gulf coast, and [[bloggers]] on the [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]] website came together in support of the victims.
