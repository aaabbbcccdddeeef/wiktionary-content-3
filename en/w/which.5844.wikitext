====Usage notes====
* (''US usage'') Some authorities insist, prescriptively, that relative '''''which''''' should be used only in non-restrictive contexts. For restrictive contexts (e.g., ''The song <u>that made the charts in 2004</u> is better than the later ones''), they prefer ''[[that]]''. Actual usage does not support this "rule". Fowler, who proposed the rule, himself acknowledged that it was "not the practice of most or of the best writers". Even E.B. White, a notorious "which-hunter", wrote this: "the premature expiration of a pig is, I soon discovered, a departure which the community marks solemnly on its calendar." In modern UK usage, ''The song which made the charts in 2004 is better than the later ones'' is generally accepted without question.

* When "which" (or the other relative pronouns "[[who]]" and "[[that]]") is used as the subject of a relative clause, the verb agrees with the antecedent of the pronoun. Thus "The thing which is...", "The things which are...", etc.

====Quotations====
* '''1611''' — [[w:King James Version of the Bible|King James Version of the Bible]], ''[[s:Bible (King James)/Luke|Luke]] 1:1''
*: Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things '''which''' are most surely believed among us...
