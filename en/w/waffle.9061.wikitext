===Etymology 1===
Borrowed from {{bor|en|nl|wafel}} into {{cog|AE.|-}}, from {{der|en|dum|wafel}}, {{m|dum|wavel}}, {{m|dum|wafele}}, from {{der|en|odt|*wāvila}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*wēbilǭ}}, {{m|gem-pro|*wēbilō}}, akin to the verb at hand in {{cog|nl|weven}}, a cognate and synonym of {{cog|en|weave}} (due to the pastry’s honeycomb pattern). This American borrowing may have been reinforced by {{der|en|de|Waffel}}, an earlier borrowing from the same Dutch source. An even earlier borrowing of {{cog|fro|walfre}} is the origin of {{cog|fr|gaufre}} and {{cog|en|wafer}}.

The verb sense "to smash" derives from the manner in which waffle-batter is smashed into its shape between the two halves of a waffle iron.

===Etymology 2===
Borrowed from {{bor|en|sco|waffle||to waver, flutter}}, a variation of the {{m|sco|waff||to flutter, wave}}, related to {{cog|en|wave}}, with the suffix {{cog|sco|-le}} added. Alternatively, perhaps derived from {{m|en|waff}}, an imitation of a dog's yelp (cf. {{m|en|woof}}). Also note {{cog|ang|wæflian||to talk foolishly}}.
