===Etymology 1===
The {{glossary|noun}} is borrowed from {{bor|en|nl|wafel|t=waffle; wafer}},<ref>{{R:OED Online|pos=''n.''{{sup|1}}|noformat=1|id=224990|date=1921|nodot=1}}; {{R:Lexico|alt=waffle{{sup|2}}|pos=n}}</ref> from {{der|en|dum|wafel}}, {{m|dum|wafele}}, {{m|dum|wavel}}, from {{der|en|odt|*wāvila}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*wēbilǭ}}, {{m|gem-pro|*wēbilō}}, possibly related to {{der|en|ine-pro|*webʰ-|t=to braid, weave}} (whence {{cog|nl|weven|t=to weave}} and {{cog|en|weave}}), and possibly reinforced by {{der|en|de|Waffel|t=waffle; wafer}}. The English word is a {{doublet|en|wafer|gauffre|nocap=1}}.

The {{glossary|verb}} (“to smash”) derives from the manner in which batter is pressed into the shape of a waffle between the two halves of a waffle iron.
