[[Image:Gaufre molle.jpg|thumb|right|A waffle (pastry).]]

===Etymology 1===
The {{etyl|nl|en}} word {{term|wafel|lang=nl}} was adopted into English in the 1700s.  The Dutch word, in turn, derives from the {{etyl|gml|en}} ''[[wafel|wāfel]]'' (modern German ''[[Waffel]]''), which was borrowed into Middle English around 1377<!--per WP--> as ''[[wafer]]'', and which is also the source of the French ''[[gaufre]]''. ''[[wafel|Wāfel]]'', in turn, derives from the Old High German ''waba'', ''wabo'' (modern German ''[[Wabe]]''), meaning ''[[honeycomb]]'' and ultimately related to the word ''[[weave]]''. The verb sense "to smash" derives from the manner in which waffle-batter is smashed into its shape between the two halves of a waffle iron, and the sense "to press a waffle pattern into" derives from the pattern the waffle-iron-halves impart<!-- duh -->.

#* '''2006''', Gordon Forbes, ''Tales from the Eagles Sideline'' (updated edition), page 2:

===Etymology 2===
From the {{etyl|sco|en}} ''[[waffle#Scots|waffle]]'', "to waver, to flutter", a variation of the {{etyl|sco|en}} ''[[waff]]'' ("to flutter, to wave", related to ''[[wave#English|wave]]''), with the suffix ''[[-le]]'' added. Alternatively, perhaps derived from ''[[waff]]'', an imitation of a dog's (unintelligible and thus meaningless) yelp ([[confer#Latin|cf]] ''[[woof]]''). Also note {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term|wæflian||to talk foolishly|lang=ang}}.
