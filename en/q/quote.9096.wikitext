====Usage notes====
{{unreferenced}}
In technically accurate English, "quote" is not a noun&mdash;it is a verb.  For meanings 1, 3, 4 above use "quotation"; for 2 use "quotation mark".  "Quote" has seen common use for well over a hundred years, however, so if you misuse it you are still likely to be understood and are unlikely to be corrected except in a highly formal or academic context.
