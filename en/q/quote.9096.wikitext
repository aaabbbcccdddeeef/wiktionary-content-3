{{also|Quote}}
==English==

===Etymology===
Recorded since 1387 "to mark (a book) with chapter numbers or marginal references", from {{etyl|fro}} [[coter]], from Medieval Latin [[quotare]] "to distinguish by numbers, number chapters", itself from {{etyl|la}}  [[quotus]] "which, what number (in sequence)," from [[quot]] "how many" (related to [[quis]] "who"). The sense developped via "to give as a reference, to cite as an authority" to "to copy out exact words" (since 1680); the business sense "to state the price of a commodity" (1866) revives the etymological meaning. The noun, in the sense of "quotation," is attested from 1885.

====Usage notes====
{{unreferenced}}
In a technical sense, "quote" is not a noun but a verb. "a Quote" has seen common use for well over a hundred years, however, so if you (mis)use it you are still likely to be understood and are unlikely to be corrected except in a highly formal or academic context.
