#* '''1877''', Arthur Conan Doyle, ''A Study in Scarlet''
#*: "There are no crimes and no criminals in these days," he said, '''querulously'''. "What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it."
