===Etymology===
Uncertain. A common proposal is {{inh|la|itc-pro|*kom}} + {{m|itc-pro|*wiros||fellow man}}, which De Vaan (2008) rejects by contrasting the phonetic evolution in {{m|la|cūria}}, yet doesn't settle on an etymon. Against this, Vine (2016) suggests that the two words could simply stem from periods of different stress, so that different syllables underwent vowel reduction: /kowiˈriː-/ > /kʷiˈriː-/ like {{cog|LL|quāgulum}} from {{m|la|coāgulum}}. <ref>{{cite-journal|en|author=Brent Vine|title=&quot;Latin bēs/bessis &#39;two thirds of an as&#39;&quot;|work=Tavet Tat Satyam: Studies in Honor of Jared S.

According to a Roman legend, from the Sabine town, {{m|la|Curēs}}, which would make it a {{bor|la|sbv|-}} loanword. In Ancient Greek the inhabitants of Cures where named {{m|grc|Κυρῖται}}.

Compare {{cog|grc|Κούρητες}}.
