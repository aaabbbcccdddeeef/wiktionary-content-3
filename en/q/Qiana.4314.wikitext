'''Qiana''' â„¢

# A trademark of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. for its silky man-made fiber which was introduced to great fanfare in 1968. The synthetic fiber was made into fabrics for men's disco shirts, women's blouses, men's neckwear and haute couture garments. Qiana was developed at a cost of $75 million as opposed to the $27 million it took to develop nylon. The vagaries of fashion and many other factors caused a decline in its popularity and it is no longer in production.
