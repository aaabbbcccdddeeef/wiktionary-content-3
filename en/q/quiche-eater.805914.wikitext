The term '''''quiche-eater''''', meaning a man who is effeminate or who lacks some putative masculine virtue, is derived from the bestselling tongue-in-cheek book on stereotypes about masculinity, ''[[Real Men Don't Eat Quiche]]'', by [[Bruce Feirstein]], published in 1982.

The term survives in [[computer programming]] circles, where it means that the target of the accusation is too far removed from practice and is more part to academic matters, unwilling to "get their hands dirty". Being humorous in nature, it is usually a fairly mild insult.

It was popularised by the [[1983]] article ''[[Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal]]''.

The article specifically accuses the creator of [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Niklaus Wirth]], of being a "quiche eater", and is generally a tongue-in-cheek bashing of the philosophy underlying Pascal (and by extension, other [[high-level programming language]]s).
