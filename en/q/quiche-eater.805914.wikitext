The term '''''quiche-eater''''', meaning a man who is effeminate or who lacks some putative masculine virtue, is derived from the bestselling [[tongue-in-cheek]] book on [[stereotype]]s about [[masculinity]], ''[[Real Men Don't Eat Quiche]]'', by [[Bruce Feirstein]], published in 1982.

The term survives in [[computer programming]] circles, where it means a person far removed from practice and concerned only with academic matters, unwilling to "get their hands dirty". Being humorous in nature, it is usually a fairly mild insult.

It was popularised by the [[1983]] article ''[[Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal]]''.  The article specifically accuses the creator of [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Niklaus Wirth]], of being a "quiche eater", and is generally a tongue-in-cheek bashing of the philosophy underlying Pascal (and by extension, other [[high-level programming language]]s).
