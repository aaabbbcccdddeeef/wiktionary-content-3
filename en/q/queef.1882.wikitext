  | passage = '''Queef''' is Scottish slang, a pronunciation variant of quiff, meaning “vulva” or “vagina”. This, together with British nautical slang where a '''queef''' is also a dialectic variant of quiff meaning “a blast of wind,” combined sometime during the last 200 years in vulgar street talk to give the current meaning of '''queef''': an explusion of air from the vulva during or often just after vigorous intercourse, commonly called a pussy fart.
