#*: Blame '''''qua''''' attitude is the feeling or belief that an individual has committed a wrongdoing, usually a wrongful action and/or harm, and can be reasonably expected not to have committed this wrongdoing. Blame qua practice is the public expression of this attitude – usually by means of censure (written or verbal criticism) or punishment. Generally, the morally worse the wrongdoing, the more severe the censure/punishment.

==Min Nan==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|[ kuã˥˥ ]|lang=nan}}

===Etymology===
The suffix has been used since around the 17th and 18th century. It is most likely an early attempt at Romanizing the Min Nan for [[官]] (POJ: [[koaⁿ]]) ''official''. Since "[[hong]]" ([[行]]) merchants were technically officials of the lowest (9th) rank, the suffix "qua" was added to their names in honour of their positions in the [[w:Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government.

===Suffix===
{{head|nan|suffix|poj|koaⁿ|traditional and simplified|官}}

# [[official]]

====Usage notes====
* Formerly added to names of [[hong]] merchants (i.e. "''Powqua,''" "''Chinqua''").

* (''Mandarin'') [[官]] ([[guān]])
