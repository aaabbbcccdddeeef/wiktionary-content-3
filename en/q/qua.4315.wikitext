==Min Nan==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|[ kuã˥˥ ]|lang=nan}}

===Etymology===
The suffix has been used since around the 17th and 18th century. It is most likely an early attempt at Romanizing the Min Nan for [[官]] (POJ: [[koaⁿ]]) ''official''. Since "[[hong]]" ([[行]]) merchants were technically officials of the lowest (9th) rank, the suffix "qua" was added to their names in honour of their positions in the [[w:Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government.

===Suffix===
{{infl|nan|suffix|poj|koaⁿ|traditional and simplified|官}}

# [[official]]

====Usage notes====
* Formerly added to names of [[hong]] merchants (i.e. "''Powqua,''" "''Chinqua''").
