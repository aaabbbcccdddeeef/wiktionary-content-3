===Suffix===
'''qua'''

*Added to names of Chinese [[hong]] merchants.
*as in "''Powqua,''" "''Chinqua''", etc.  

===Etymology===
The suffix has been used since around the 17th and 18th century. It is believed to be a corruption of the word [[kuan]] - meaning ''official'' in Chinese.  Since "hong" merchants were technically [[Mandarin]]s of the lowest (9th) rank, the suffix "qua" was added to their names in honour of their positions in the [[w:Qing]] government.
