'''quaternion'''

#A four-dimensional [[hypercomplex number]] that consists of a real dimension and 3 imaginary ones (''i'', ''j'', ''k'') that are each a [[square root]] of -1.  They are commonly used in [[vector]] mathematics and three-dimensional games.  [[Quaternion multiplication]] is the most common technique used by mathematicians to avoid [[gimbal lock]] when rotating [[vector]]s.
