#{{organic chemistry}} Any of several [[triterpenoid]]s related to [[quassin]]
The quassinoids are a group of complex, highly oxygenated, degraded triterpene biogenetically formed from triterpene apo-euphol or its 20 a-isomer apo-tirucallol. The triterpenoid biogenetic pathway for the quassinoids has been experimentally verified by using labelled mevalonate precursors. They have varying numbers of oxygen containing groups (e.g. hydroxyl or esterified hydroxyl, carbonyl, oxide, methoxyl, or carboxymethyl) and lactones (d-lactones in the C20 and g-lactones in the C18, C19, C25 compounds). Interest in these quassinoids has increased enormously in recent years due in part to the finding of the American National Cancer Institute that these compounds display marked antileukamic activity.
