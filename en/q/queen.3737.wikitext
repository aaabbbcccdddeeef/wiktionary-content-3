====Usage notes====
* {{sense|homosexual man}} The term can be either derogatory or a self-identification. {{qualifier|Compare {{m|en|nigger}}.}}
* {{sense|LGBT}} Some of the people who were historically (in the late 1960s and 1970s) described as “queens” or “[[drag queen]]s” or “[[street queen]]s” are now sometimes considered [[transgender]], especially when their [[gender identity]] is female or [[non-binary]]/[[genderqueer]] rather than male. Some people, like Sylvia Rivera, self-identified as both a “transgender person” and a “street queen”. Drag queens, too, can have any gender identity.
