===Etymology===
The true etymology is unknown.  The following have all been proposed:
*Reputed without evidence to have been invented by a late 18th century Dublin theatre proprietor who [[bet]] he could add a new nonsense [[word]] to the English language. He thus had the word painted on walls all over the city. The morning after, everyone was talking about the new word.
*The original meaning is [[interrogation]] (1867), being derived from the verb. Current meaning only since 1941.
*The meaning "hoax" is the original (1796), shifting to the meaning "interrogate" (1847) under the influence of '''to [[question]]''' and '''[[inquisitive]]'''.
*Originally ''quies'' (1847), may have derived from Latin ''qui es?'' (who are you?), traditionally the first question in [[oral]] Latin [[exam]]s. Used as a noun from 1867, spelling quiz first recorded in 1886.
