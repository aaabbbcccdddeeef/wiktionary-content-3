===Etymology===
Attested since the 1780s, of {{unk|en|nocap=y}} origin.
* The ''Century Dictionary'' suggests it was originally applied to a popular toy, from a dialectal variant of {{m|en|whiz}}.
* The ''Random House Dictionary'' suggests the original sense was "odd person" (circa 1780).
* Others suggest the meaning "hoax" was original (1796), shifting to the meaning "interrogate" (1847) under the influence of ''[[question]]'' and ''[[inquisitive]]''.
* Some say without evidence it was invented by a late-18th-century Dublin theatre proprietor who [[bet]] he could add a new nonsense [[word]] to the English language; he had the word painted on walls all over the city, and the morning after, everyone was talking about it.
* Others suggest it was originally ''quies'' (1847), Latin ''qui es?'' (who are you?), traditionally the first question in [[oral]] Latin [[exam]]s. They suggest that it was first used as a noun from 1867, and the spelling ''quiz'' first recorded in 1886, but this is demonstrably incorrect.
* A further derivation, assuming that the original sense is "good, ingenuous, harmless man, overly conventional, pedantic, rule-bound man, square; nerd; oddball, eccentric",<ref>Compare {{cite-web|title=The Origin of the Word Quiz|url=http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/the_origin_of_the_word_quiz|work=Museum of Hoaxes|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=27 March 2019}}</ref> is based on a column from 1785 which claims that the origin is a jocular translation of the Horace quotation ''vir bonus est quis'' as "the good man is a quiz" at Cambridge.<ref>{{cite-web|author=Tréguer, Pascal|title=origin of 'quiz' ("Vir bonus est quis?")?|url=https://wordhistories.net/2017/05/12/origin-of-quiz/|work=Word Histories – How Words and Phrases Came into Existence|date=12 May 2017|accessdate=27 March 2019}}</ref>
