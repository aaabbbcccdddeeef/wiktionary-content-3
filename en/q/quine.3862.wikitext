#*: As with the puzzle of what happens during the combustion of a metal in pure oxygen (the "steel wool" experiment), this result can of course be '''quined'''.

#*: Daniel Dennett's ''The Philosophical Lexicon'' defines "quine" as a verb: "to deny the existence or significance of something real or significant".

#*: "Quining" is what I called it in my book. (He certainly didn't call it that!) '''Quining''' is an operation that I define on any string of English. {{...}} Here is an example of a '''quined''' phrase: "is a sentence with no subject" is a sentence with no subject.
