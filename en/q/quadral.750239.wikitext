#* '''2000''', Greville G. Corbett, ''Number'', page 30:
#*: These are the three best claims for '''quadrals'''. There are several false trails in the literature, that is, suggestions of other Austronesian languages with '''quadrals''', which turn out in fact to have four number values not five.
#* '''2008''', Martin Haspelmath, ''Language typology and language universals: an international handbook'', volume 1, page 819:
#*: There is a question as to whether there are also languages with '''quadrals''' (for reference to four entities). However, having raised the issue of paucals, we shall first continue the analysis of these, and only then return to the question {{...}}
