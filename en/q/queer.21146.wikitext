#* '''1865''', {{w|Lewis Carroll}}, ''{{w|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}}''
#*: “I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a '''queer''' thing, to be sure! However, everything is '''queer''' to-day.”

#*:One thing has struck me as a bit '''queer'''. During my two terms of office the whole Democratic press, and the morbidly honest and 'reformatory' portion of the Republican press, thought it horrible to keep U.S. troops stationed in the Southern States, and when they were called upon to protect the lives of negroes–as much citizens under the Constitution as if their skins were white–the country was scarcely large enough to hold the sound of indignation belched forth by them for some years. Now, however, there is no hesitation about exhausting the whole power of the government to suppress a strike on the slightest intimation that danger threatens.
#* '''1885''', {{w|David Dixon Porter}}, p. 274, [https://archive.org/details/incidentsanecdot00portiala ''Incidents and Anecdotes of the Civil War'']
#*:It looked '''queer''' to me to see boxes labeled "His Excellency, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America." The packages so labeled contained Bass ale or Cognac brandy, which cost "His Excellency" less than we Yankees had to pay for it. Think of the President drinking imported liquors while his soldiers were living on pop-corn and water!

====Usage notes====
* The use of ''queer'' to mean "homosexual" was formerly pejorative, and it may still be considered pejorative, especially by older speakers. Many younger speakers have reclaimed the term, however, as a positive descriptor. The pejorative applied mainly to males; the reclaimed term is used of all genders and, indeed, it is used by some speakers as a synonym of [[LGBT]], for referring to the whole gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, etc community.<!-- This usage may include people who display heterosexual behavior.--><ref>[http://www.glaad.org/reference/lgb GLAAD media reference guide]</ref> (Compare {{m|en|genderqueer}}, a positive umbrella term for noncisgender or nonmale, nonfemale gender identities.) In particular, ''queer'' has often been used by gay and LGBT people who reject mainstream-gay values and culture as overly conservative and [[assimilationist]]. See {{w|Queer#Etymology|Wikipedia}} for more.
