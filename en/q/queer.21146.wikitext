#* '''1865''', {{w|Lewis Carroll}}, ''{{w|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}}''
#*: “I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a '''queer''' thing, to be sure! However, everything is '''queer''' to-day.”

#*: One thing has struck me as a bit '''queer'''. During my two terms of office the whole Democratic press, and the morbidly honest and 'reformatory' portion of the Republican press, thought it horrible to keep U.S. troops stationed in the Southern States, and when they were called upon to protect the lives of negroes–as much citizens under the Constitution as if their skins were white–the country was scarcely large enough to hold the sound of indignation belched forth by them for some years. Now, however, there is no hesitation about exhausting the whole power of the government to suppress a strike on the slightest intimation that danger threatens.
#* '''1885''', {{w|David Dixon Porter}}, page 274, [https://archive.org/details/incidentsanecdot00portiala ''Incidents and Anecdotes of the Civil War'']
#*: It looked '''queer''' to me to see boxes labeled "His Excellency, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America." The packages so labeled contained Bass ale or Cognac brandy, which cost "His Excellency" less than we Yankees had to pay for it. Think of the President drinking imported liquors while his soldiers were living on pop-corn and water!

#* '''1999''', {{w|Judith Butler}}, ''Gender Trouble'', Routledge 2002, Preface to 1999 edition:
#*: If gender is no longer to be understood as consolidated through normative sexuality, then is there a crisis of gender that is specific to '''queer''' contexts?

====Usage notes====
* The use of ''queer'' to mean "non-heterosexual" was formerly pejorative, and it may still be considered pejorative by older speakers. Many younger speakers have reclaimed the term, however, as a positive descriptor. The pejorative applied mainly to those assigned [[male]] at birth who were perceived as either homosexual or effeminate; the reclaimed term is also used of those assigned [[female]] at birth.<ref>[http://www.glaad.org/reference/lgb GLAAD media reference guide]</ref> (Compare {{m|en|genderqueer}}, a positive umbrella term for [[noncisgender]] and [[non-binary]] — [[nonmale]], [[nonfemale]] — [[gender identity|gender identities]].)
* In particular, ''queer'' has often been used by people who reject mainstream ''gay'' values and culture as overly conservative and [[assimilationist]]. See {{w|Queer#Etymology|Wikipedia}} for more.
