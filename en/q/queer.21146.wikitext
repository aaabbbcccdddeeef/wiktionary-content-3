====Usage notes====
* The use of this word to mean "homosexual" was formerly, and is often still, considered pejorative.  However, in the way that all language is dynamic and pliable, the word is also sometimes now used (primarily as adjective) as a neutral or even positive descriptive term, including by some (primarily younger) homosexuals. In its pejorative use, it is applied almost solely to males. In its modern neutral use, it can be applied to all genders.

: Some [[GLBT]] youth now use the term as an "all-inclusive" term for the GLBTIQ (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, Intersex, Queer) etc. community.

: 'Queer' is also used as a positive term for people who reject mainstream-gay values and culture.  People who identify with this version of queer distance themselves from the commercialisation and (relatively) conformist values of the gay mainstream and embrace fluid and unconstrained definitions of sexuality and gender.  There is some common ground between this definition of queer and the punk and DIY scenes. See also "[[genderqueer]]".

* In the English dialect of the southern United States, the two senses of the adjective ''queer'' (''homosexual'' and ''weird, odd, different, or unwell'') are sometimes distinguished by pronunciation.  Queer (''homosexual'') is pronounced (kwîr), queer (''weird, odd, different, or unwell'') is pronounced (kwär).  This is generally considered old-fashioned and is only used when the word is emphasized, as in the phrase "''that's awful '''queer'''''" (pronounced THăts ôr'fəl kwär).  The distinction is dying out as that latter sense of the word dies out.
