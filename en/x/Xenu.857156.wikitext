|text=Seventy-five million years ago there was a galactic confederation consisting of seventy-six planets which had an over-population problem. The head of the confederation was named '''Xenu''' and he resolved that he would entice the entire population of the confederacy to Earth (called Teegeeach) and blow them up.[...]Contacting the BTs is done telepathically and they are then guided back down the time-track to the moment seventy-five million years ago when '''Xenu''' vaporized them, which is known as Incident 2.}}

This traumatic event separated the thetans from their bodies. These deeply troubled thetans attach themselves in their millions to humans today; and are responsible for illness, perversion and many of the other problems of the human race. Advanced levels of auditing can help Scientologists to rid themselves of these ‘body thetans’.}}

It is a serious event considered to have happened.}}

But fearing they'd be denounced for doubting Hubbard's teachings—to do so would be a thought crime — they held their tongue.}}
