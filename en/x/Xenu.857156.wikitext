|passage=At the heart of Scientology's belief system is the story of Xenu who, 76 million years ago, imprisoned the billions of people of the 75 planets of the Galactic Federation in volcanoes on Earth and dropped H-bombs on them. This traumatic event separated the thetans from their bodies. These deeply troubled thetans attach themselves in their millions to humans today; and are responsible for illness, perversion and many of the other problems of the human race. Advanced levels of auditing can help Scientologists to rid themselves of these 'body thetans'.)}}

'''Scientologists are not allowed to learn this story till they reach an advanced level of training, the word has therefore become a [[shibboleth]] and those who are willing to say or write Xenu publicly demonstrate that they are not [[Scientologist]]s.
