#* {{quote-book|year=2007|author=Una McGovern|title=Chambers Dictionary of the Unexplained|url=http://www.amazon.com/Chambers-Dictionary-Unexplained-Una-McGovern/dp/0550102159|isbn=0550102159|publisher=Chambers|page=607|passage=At the heart of Scientology’s belief system is the story of a galactic dictator called '''Xenu''' who, 76 million years ago, imprisoned the billions of people of the 75 planets of the Galactic Federation in volcanoes on Earth and dropped H-bombs on them. This traumatic event separated the thetans from their bodies. These deeply troubled thetans attach themselves in their millions to humans today; and are responsible for illness, perversion and many of the other problems of the human race. Advanced levels of auditing can help Scientologists to rid themselves of these ‘body thetans’.}}

It is a serious event considered to have happened.}}

But fearing they'd be denounced for doubting Hubbard's teachings—to do so would be a thought crime — they held their tongue.}}
