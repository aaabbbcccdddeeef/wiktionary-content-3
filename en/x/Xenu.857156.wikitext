This traumatic event separated the thetans from their bodies. These deeply troubled thetans attach themselves in their millions to humans today; and are responsible for illness, perversion and many of the other problems of the human race. Advanced levels of auditing can help Scientologists to rid themselves of these ‘body thetans’.}}

It is a serious event considered to have happened.}}
#*{{quote-book|year=2009|author=James R. Lewis|title=Scientology|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=|isbn=|page=91|passage=Briefly, one such event is what is known as "Incident 2," which occurred seventy-five million years ago. In this incident the leader ('''Xenu''') of a group of seventy-six planets (the Galactic Confederation) responded to massive overpopulation by transporting large numbers of people to Earth (Teegeeack) and detonating hydrogen bombs in volcanoes to kill the people. Although the bodies were destroyed, the thetans survived.}}

But fearing they'd be denounced for doubting Hubbard's teachings—to do so would be a thought crime — they held their tongue.}}
