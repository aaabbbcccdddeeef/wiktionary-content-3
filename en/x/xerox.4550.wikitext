The Xerox trademark is at risk of becoming generic because of this use. The company is engaged in an ongoing campaign to convince the public that Xerox should not be used as a verb. To this end, the company has written to publications that have used Xerox as a verb, and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that "you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on" a photocopier, particularly "a Xerox Brand copying machine."
