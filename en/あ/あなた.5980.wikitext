{{ja-spellings|貴方|彼方|貴女|貴男}}

===Etymology===
Compound of {{compound|lang=ja|sort=あなた|あ|tr1=a|pos1=[[distal]] pronoun marker, indicating something far away from both speaker and listener; also found in {{m|ja|あれ||tr=are|that|pos=far away}}, {{m|ja|あそこ||tr=asoko|there|pos=far away}}, etc.|な|tr2=na|pos2=possessive, ancient compounding alternative for particle {{ja-r|の}}|た|tr3=ta|t3=direction, side, place|pos3=only found in ancient terms}}.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>

Originally meant {{m|en|[[that]] [[direction]], that [[side]] ([[far]] [[away]])}}, in contrast to {{ja-r|そなた||[[that]] [[direction]], that [[side]], that [[place]] (closer to the listener)}}, {{ja-r|こなた||[[this]] direction, this  [[side]], this [[place]] (close to both listener and speaker)}}, and {{ja-r|どなた||[[which]] or [[what]] direction, side, or place}}.  Appears with this sense at least as early as the ''{{w|Kokin Wakashū}}'' of the late 900s,<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref> and the ''{{w|Kagerō Nikki}}'' of 974 CE.<ref>'''974''', ''{{w|Kagerō Nikki}}'' (“The Mayfly Diary”), by {{w|Michitsuna no Haha|Michitsuna's mother}} (in Japanese), text available online [http://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/kagero/MicKage.html here]</ref>

The [[indirect]] and [[polite]] sense of ''that'' {{m|en|person}} is also evident in texts from the late 900s, including the ''{{w|Ochikubo Monogatari}}''.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>

The sense of {{m|en|you}} as a polite and indirect form of reference appears in texts from around the 1750s.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>

====Usage notes====
The {{m|en|you}} sense is spelled most often in [[hiragana]] in modern usage.  The {{m|ja|貴方}} spelling is gender-neutral. Alternative spellings include {{m|ja|貴女}} when referring to females and {{m|ja|貴男}} when referring to males.

{{ja-r|あなた}} is the most neutral second-person singular pronoun. If names or titles are known, these are used more commonly when addressing people.
