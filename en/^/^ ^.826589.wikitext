===Etymology===
First used in 1986 in an online [[Deaf]] community in Japan, independently from [[Unsupported titles/Colon hyphen right paren|:-)]].<ref>[http://deafcomic.jp/Others/FaceMark.html {{lang|ja|顔文字の起源 (^_^)}}], 2006</ref> The difference between [[Unsupported titles/Colon hyphen right paren|:-)]] and '''^_^''' is likely to come from Western and Eastern ways of looking at facial expressions.<ref>Cell Press, [//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090813142131.htm ''Facial Expressions Show Language Barriers, Too''], ScienceDaily, 16 August 2009:<br>“We show that Easterners and Westerners look at different face features to read facial expressions,” said Rachael E. Jack of The University of Glasgow. “Westerners look at the eyes and the mouth in equal measure, whereas Easterners favor the eyes and neglect the mouth.” […]<br>“Interestingly, there are clear cultural differences in the formations of these icons.” Western emoticons primarily use the mouth to convey emotional states, e.g. {{nobr|: )}} for happy and {{nobr|: (}} for sad, she noted, whereas Eastern emoticons use the eyes, e.g. {{nobr|^.^}} for happy and {{nobr|;_;}} for sad.</ref>
