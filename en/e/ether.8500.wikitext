===Etymology 2===
From “[[w:Ether (song)|Ether]]” (2001), a song by the American [[hip hop]] [[recording artist]] {{w|Nas}} (born 1973). According to Nas, the song, a [[diss track]] aimed at fellow artist {{w|Jay-Z}} (born 1969), was thus named because he was once told that [[ghost#Noun|ghosts]] and [[spirit#Noun|spirits]] do not like the [[fume#Noun|fumes]] from ether, and he viewed the song as affecting Jay-Z in a similar way. The song contains the lines “I fuck with your soul like ether” and “That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow”.
