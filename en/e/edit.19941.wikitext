                  ''''''The Road To Chlifa''''''

Karim went to Nada's house for his brithday and kissed her, that way Karim showed how much he loved her(Marineau 45). Also, Karim accepted to go to Chlifa with Maha and Jad because he had nobody to look forward to. "I'm going with you. I think i know how we could get out of the city"(61). Moreover, Karim helped Maha get across the border without considering how dangerous it could get to cross between Muslims and Christians(65). Truley, those acts need bravery and courage to make someone honourable.

     Not only being brave but also responsibile made Karim a honourable person. For instants, Karim saved My-Lan a classmate of his from some guys who wanted to bother her. So, those boys dragged her to the bathroom. In the mean time, suddenly Karim stepped indide and said,"Let go of her", "Leave her alone" and by saying that he drew the boy's attention to him. Those boys who were known as Dave and his gangs, started to bother him a little but then the problem got serious and Dave stabbed Karim(132). Karim did all those things because of not protecting Maha in the past. Therefore, Karim's responsibility helped him to be called a honourable person. 

     Kindness may be a requirement in order to make someone an honourable person. " For starters, pass me Jad. We can take turns carying him. It won't be as tiring that way" (61). As well, Karim milked the goat for himself and Maha for both of them to drink. Furthermore, he buried Maha under the shade of a juniper tree, that's what Maha always wanted to see but she never got to see one(131). Additionally, Karim kept in touch with Bechir and wrote him letters (141). In conclusion, Karim had kindness to be called a symbol of honour. 

     Karim a young man who was brave and couragous, kind and responsible was a symbol of honour. Karim helped a little gril with a baby get to Chlifa, raised the little gril's brother, kept in touch with his old friend, deserved to be called a hounourable and courageous person. Besides, Karim helped lots of other young people like him to learn how to be honourable and courageous. To sum up, Karim had bravery and courage, was kind and responsible and was sure worthy of being called a symbol of honour.
