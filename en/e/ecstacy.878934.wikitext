Ecstacy is commonly known as ecstasy. Ecstasy (MDMA) or MethyleneDioxyMethAmphetamine, is a stimulant and an hallucinogen. It speeds up the central nervous system. Ecstasy is often used as a mood enhancer at parties and nightclubs. It is a synthetic drug usually sold as small tablets, in a variety of colours and sizes, but also comes in capsules or powder.

Ecstasy can be taken orally, snorted, injected or anally (as a suppository). Common slang terms for ecstasy include the ‘love drug’, ‘E’ and ‘eckies’. Ecstasy is usually swallowed as a tablet but can also come in powder form. Its effects begin around an hour after taking the drug and might last for up to 32 hours.

Ecstasy works by prompting the brain to initiate this ‘fight or flight’ response and the user feels refreshed by a burst of energy. Ecstasy’s hallucinogenic properties distort the user’s experience of reality by triggering hallucinations of both sight and sound.
