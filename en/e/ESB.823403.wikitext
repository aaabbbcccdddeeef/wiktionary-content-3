# {{ISO 4217|hist=1|nolink=1|fund=1|for foreign-owned accounts in '''''{{w|Spanish peseta|convertible Spanish pesetas}}'''''|to=1993}}
#: {{coord|mul|ESA|ESP}}

====Usage notes====
This code was used in relation to foreign-owned accounts holding {{w|Spanish peseta|convertible pesetas}}, which could be used for the transfer of funds from {{w|Spain}} to foreign countries (sometimes referred to as "B" accounts). In 1985, these subsumed the function of the abolished "A" accounts (code {{l|mul|ESA}}), which were foreign-owned accounts which could be used for transactions in Spain. "B" accounts were themselves abolished in 1993.
