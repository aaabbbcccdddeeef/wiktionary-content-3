===Pronunciation===
*Hyphenation: et
*{{IPA|et}}

===Verb===
'''et'''

# The second-person singular form of the [[negation]] [[verb]]. The English translations include ''[[do]] [[not]]''/''[[don't|don’t]]'' and ''[[not]]'' (with auxiliary verbs and ''[[be]]'').

====Conjugation====
*The negative verb has ''no infinitive form''. The negative verb is conjugated only in person, not in tense or mood. (For the second person singular of the negative verb in the [[imperative]] mood, see ''[[älä]]''.)

====Usage notes====
*The negative verb is used with the connegative form of the main verb. That form is identical to the second-person singular imperative in the indicative present. The potential mood connegative ends in the marker for the mood, ''-ne-'', and the conditional mood connegative ends in the marker for the mood, ''-isi-''. In the indicative past, conditional past and potential past, the ''active'' past participle singular (ending -''ut''/-''yt'') is used. ''The connegative form of the main verb is always used without the personal suffix''.

:*Usage of ''et'':
::*Indicative:

:::*[[sinä|Sinä]] [[nähdä|näet]]. (You see.) -> Sinä '''et''' näe. (You ''do not'' see.)
:::*Sinä näit. (You saw.) -> Sinä '''et''' nähnyt. (You ''did not'' see.)
:::*Sinä [[olla|olet]] nähnyt. (You have seen.) -> Sinä '''et''' ole nähnyt. (You have ''not'' seen.)
:::*Sinä olit nähnyt. (You had seen.) -> Sinä '''et''' ollut nähnyt. (You had ''not'' seen.)

::*Conditional:
:::*Sinä näkisit. (You would see.) -> Sinä '''et''' näkisi. (You would ''not'' see.)
:::*Sinä olisit nähnyt. (You would have seen.) -> Sinä '''et''' olisi nähnyt. (You would ''not'' have seen.)

::*Potential:
:::*Sinä nähnet. (You probably see.) -> Sinä '''et''' nähne. (You probably ''do not'' see.)
:::*Sinä lienet nähnyt. (You have probably seen.) -> Sinä '''et''' liene nähnyt. (You have probably ''not'' seen.)
