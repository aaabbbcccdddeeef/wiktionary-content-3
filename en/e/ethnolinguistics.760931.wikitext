# The field of [[linguistic anthropology]] which studies the language of a specific ethnic group.

Ethnolinguistics is closely related to various other disciplines such as linguistic anthropology and cultural linguistics (see Boas, Whorf, and Sapir). What are the keywords of a community ? How do the speakers of a language understand those feelings and thoughts that we would like to consider to be ‘universal’, such as life, love, and art? Some traditions in ethnolingiustics go back to the Herder-Humboldt premise that languages represent the worldviews of their linguistic communities. This school is defended by various groups in Europe and around the world, such as the Rouen Ethnolinguistics Project in France (http://rep.univ-rouen.fr ), and the Linguistic Worldview project directed by Jerzy Bartminski in Lublin, Poland. Other recent developments in ethnolinguistics in recent decades in the English-speaking world include Anna Wierzbicka’s Natural Semantics Metalanguage, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLEhrIF9Cnk3P1trmSwMGyg. Wierzbicka’s group focuses on individual keywords, and the fundamental universals which she argues do not come to more than one hundred basic words. Other scholars focus on the way concepts 'migrate' from culture to culture, for example Underhill & Gianninoto in their Migrating Meanings: Sharing Keywords in a Global World, 2019, which considers the way concepts like ‘citizen’ and ‘individual’ pass from European world views into the Chinese lexicon, and the way the Chinese people reformulate in their own dynamic way the notions they adopt.For more on the historical background of ethnolinguistics, see the Jürgen Trabant Wilhelm von Humboldt lectures on the REP website, http://rep.univ-rouen.fr/content/films-trabant
