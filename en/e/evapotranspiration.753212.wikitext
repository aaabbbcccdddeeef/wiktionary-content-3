# The [[transfer]] of [[water]] from the surface of the earth to the [[atmosphere]] by [[evaporation]], [[sublimation]] and [[transpiration]].
#* '''1998''', R. B. Singh (editor), ''Ecological Techniques and Approaches to Vulnerable Environment: Hydrosphere-Geosphere Interaction'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=65_uAAAAMAAJ&q=%22evapotranspirations%22&dq=%22evapotranspirations%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih46u6zq7aAhVIHpAKHV3AD2UQ6AEIRTAF page 25],
#*: Calculated '''evapotranspirations''' are climatological values, namely the long-term average of the '''evapotranspirations'''.
#* '''2004''', Keith J. Beven, ''Rainfall - Runoff Modelling: The Primer'', John Wiley & Sons ({{ISBN|9780470866719}}), page 59
#*: In many environments, '''evapotranspiration''' makes up a larger proportion of the catchment water balance than the stream discharge. Thus, for longer periods of rainfall–runoff simulation, it will generally be necessary to estimate actual '''evapotranspiration''' losses from a catchment in order to have an adequate representation of the antecedent state of the catchment prior to each rainfall event.

Sørensen (editor), ''Agricultural Water Management Research Trends'', Nova Science Publishers, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bGj_S52c8S0C&pg=PA51&dq=%22evapotranspirations%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih46u6zq7aAhVIHpAKHV3AD2UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=%22evapotranspirations%22&f=false page 51],
#*: SWAP estimates that all the components of the water balance and the simulated '''evapotranspirations''' do not comprise percolation.{{...}}Figure 10A shows the ratios between sugarbeet '''evapotranspirations''' estimated by water balance and the SWAP-simulated '''evapotranspirations'''.
