“Plato considered geometry and numbers as the most reduced and essential, and therefore the ideal, philosophical language.  Butt it is only by virtue of functioning at a certain ‘level’ of reality that geometry and number can become a vehicle for philosophic contemplation.  Greek philosophy defined this notion of ‘levels’, so useful in our thinking, distinguishing the ‘typal’ and the ‘archetypal.’  Following the indication given by the Egyptian wall reliefs, which are laid out in three registers, an upper, a middle and a lower, we can define a third level, the ectypal, situated between the archetypal and the typal. “ Robert Lawlor - sacred geomety;  1982 Thames & Hudson ltd, London
