====Usage notes====
Modern accepted use of the terms ''epicurean'' and {{term|Epicureanism}} refers often to the appreciation of, and indulgement in, good food ([[gourmet]]), luxury, hedonism, and sensual pleasure.  This strays significantly from the original philoposhic intent of Epicureanism.  The philosophy indeed elevated pleasure and happiness as the most worthy pursuit, but specifically warned against fine food and frequent sex, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later.  Instead, the goal was a long-term pleasure, marked by serenity and temperance, achieved through moderation rather than indulging.  Modern senses of gourmet, luxury, hedonism, sensual pleasure and lust are mostly in contrast with the original ancient teachings.
