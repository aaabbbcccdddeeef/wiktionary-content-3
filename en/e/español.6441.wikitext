{{ast-decl-adj|español|m=español|mpl=españoles}}
I've been alone with you inside my mind
 And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
 I sometimes see you pass outside my door
 Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
 I can see it in your smile
 You're all I've ever wanted, (and) my arms are open wide
 'Cause you know just what to say
 And you know just what to do
 And I want to tell you so much, I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
 And tell you time and time again how much I care
 Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
 Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
 And I wonder what you do
 Are you somewhere feeling lonely, or is someone loving you?
 Tell me how to win your heart
 For I haven't got a clue
 But let me start by saying, I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

From {{etyl|prv|es}} {{poop|espaignol}}, from {{sinyore|ML.|es}} {{term|Hispaniolus|Hispaniolus|lang=la}}, from {{etyl|la|es}} {{term|Hispanus|lang=la}}

For you I'd write a symphony,
 I'd tell the violin,
 It's time to sink or swim,
 Watch them play for ya,
 For you I'd be, (whoa oh)
 Running a thousand miles,
 Just to get to where you are.

Step to the beat of my heart,
 I don't need a whole lot,
 But for you I admit I,
 I'd rather give you the world,
 Or we can share mine,
 I know I won't be the first one,
 giving you all this attention,
 Baby listen,
 I just need somebody to love,
 I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
 Somebody to love.
 I don't need nothing else,
 I promise girl I swear,
 I just need somebody to love.
 I need somebody, I need somebody,
 I need somebody, I need somebody

Every day,
 I bring the sun around,
 I sweep away the clouds,
 Smile for me.
 I would take,
 Every second, every single time,
 Spend it like my last dime.

Step to the beat of my heart,
 I don't need a whole lot,
 But for you I admit I,
 I'd rather give you the world,
 Or we can share mine,
 I know I won't be the first one,
 Givin' you all this attention,
 Baby listen,
 I just need somebody to love,
 I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
 Somebody to love.
 I don't need nothing else,
 I promise girl I swear,
 I just need somebody to love.
 I need somebody, I need somebody,
 I need somebody, I need somebody
 Somebody to love.
 I need somebody, I need somebody,
 I need somebody, I need somebody
 I just need somebody to love.

And you can have it all,
 Anything you want,
 I can bring; give you the finer things, yeah
 But what I really want,
 I can't find cause,
 Money can't find me,
 Somebody to love (oh, oh)
 Find me somebody to love (whoah ohh)

I need somebody to love,
 I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
 Somebody to love.
 I don't need nothing else,
 I promise girl I swear,
 I just need somebody to love.
 I need somebody, I need somebody,
 I need somebody, I need somebody
 Somebody to love.
 I need somebody, I need somebody,
 I need somebody, I need somebody
 I just need somebody to love.

I need somebody, I need somebody,
 I need somebody, I need somebody
 I need somebody to love.
 To love, to love.
 Is she out there? [x3]
 I just need somebody to love.

# [["Baby" by a faggot cunt with  a small penis]] Love me long time
 (feat. Ludacris)

Ohh wooaah [x3]

You know you love me, I know you care
 Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
 You are my love, you are my heart
 And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
 We're just friends, what are you saying?
 Say there's another and look right in my eyes
 My first love broke my heart for the first time
 And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
 And I just can't believe we ain't together
 And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
 I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
 And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
 And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
 I'm going down, down, down, down
 And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
 Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

[Ludacris:]
 Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
 There was nobody that compared to my baby
 and nobody came between us or could ever come above
 She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
 she woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks.
 She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
 at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
 She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
 and now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
 Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
 Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
 Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)]]
 I'm gone
