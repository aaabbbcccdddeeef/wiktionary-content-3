==Spanish==

===Etymology===
Probably a thirteenth-century borrowing from {{bor|es|pro|espaignol}} (compare modern {{cog|oc|espanhòl}}, {{cog|ca|espanyol}}, {{cog|pt|espanhol}}, {{cog|fr|espagnol}}), from {{der|es|VL.|*Hispaniolus|t=of Spain}}<ref>{{R:DRAE|entry=español|id=GUSX1EQ}}</ref>, from {{der|es|la|hispānus|Hispānus}}, from {{m|la|Hispānia}}. According to phonetic rules, if inherited from Latin, the Castilian Spanish result would have been *''españuelo'' (though some argue that this did not take root because the suffix {{m|es|-uelo}} would be perceived as diminutive; more likely, it was simply because there was no need at the time for a common secular name for all the inhabitants of Christian Iberia/Spain, and a common identity as a unified people or entity had not yet been formed. Until then, the people used {{m|es|cristiano|t=Christian}} to refer to themselves). The word {{m|es||español}} was supposedly imported from Provence by a medieval chronicler (it was originally introduced by pilgrims in Santiago) because there was no existing translation of the earlier Roman word ''Hispani'' when writing a chronicle of Spanish history, but this was the word Provençal speakers used to refer to the Christian kingdoms of what would later become Spain<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=uJdbJK_sl2oC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>. In Old Spanish there was also a form {{m|osp|españón}} which disappeared after the first half of the 14th century, possibly derived from a Vulgar Latin {{m|la|*Hispaniōnem}}<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=V4f8ZpJAhgIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>. Compare also {{m|es|espanesco}}, the word Mozarabic speakers used for themselves, presumably from a {{cog|VL.|*Hispaniscus}}.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=uJdbJK_sl2oC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>
