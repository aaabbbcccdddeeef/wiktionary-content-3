Part of our task has been preparing our students to meet the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards which address what students must know before graduating high school. These standards have been made part of our curriculum in each subject area. Additionally, we continue to use a system of post assessments in each subject to help measure student growth and develop teaching strategies to meet student needs.

We also continue to provide a range of activities for students to participate in and show off their talents. Some of these include regular curricular activities and projects; orchestra and chorus; our annual spelling bee; various art projects, including our winter open house display; physical education demonstrations; field day; intramurals; and more.

The students continue to use the technology at their disposal. They have developed research projects, used the internet to help expand their information base, and have used their computers to develop team work as well as to reinforce or extend their skills.

In keeping with our high standards and expectations for our students, we recognize their achievements in a variety of ways including the Principal's Award; Presidential Academic Awards and Presidential Fitness Awards; the Lincoln School Honor Roll; and for our special recognitions for academics, art, writing, and more.

Our highly experienced staff continues to deliver the best educational opportunities for all students based on the state's initiatives and others we feel are necessary to fulfill our educational philosophy, while rounding out the students' education with curricular extensions such as field trips, in-house programs, guest speakers, plays and extra curricular activities.
