It's the real Wikipedia is Communism and I'm back! I've been taking a vacation for vandalism for a few months and I see that some people decided to step in for me while I was gone, and that the "Wikipedia is Communism" message is bigger than ever! (Unfortunately, though, apparently the Wikipedian communists are magically blocking my names (as well as my impostors' names) faster than ever, even before they post.) And now I'm back and better than ever! I'll be spreading the "Wikipedia is Communism" message quite a bit in the near future. Currently I am doing "classic" Wikipedia is Communism vandalism (and slight variations on it such as this) but that will soon change. Right now I'm catching up on the latest trends on wiki-vandalism and working on a long guide explaining why Wikipedia (as well as other Wikimedia communist projects) is bad and how to vandalize it.

Just wanted to tell everyone I'm back!

A CELEBRATION IS IN ORDER INDEED!
