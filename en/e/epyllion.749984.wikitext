An '''epyllion''' is a brief [[narrative]] [[poem]] with a [[romantic love| romantic]] or [[mythological]] [[theme]]. The term was not used until the [[Nineteenth Century]].  It refers primarily to the type of erotic and mythological long elegy of which [[Ovid]] remains the master; to a lesser degree, the term includes some poems of the [[English Renaissance]], particularly those influenced by Ovid.
An example of an epyllion can be seen in Aeneid IX: the story of Nisus and Euryalus.
