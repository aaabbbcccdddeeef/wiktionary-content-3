'''Eu-''' (Greek εὖ-, the combining form of the adjective ευς "good") is a prefix meaning "good, well". From [[PIE]] ''*hsu-'', it is cognate to [[Sanskrit]] ''su-'' with the same meaning. The antonymous prefix is ''[[dys-]]'' (δυσ-),  PIE ''*dus-'', Sanskrit ''dur-''.

In English, the prefix occurs mostly in words directly loaned from Greek, such as [[eulogy]], [[euphemism]], [[evangelist]], [[eucharist]], [[eucalyptus]], [[eudemonic]], [[euonymous]], [[euphoria]], [[eurhythmy]], [[euthanasia]], but it has some productivity, e.g. in [[eucaryote]], [[eugenic]], [[euchlorine]].

Note that the ''Eu-'' in ''[[Europe]]'' is unrelated.
