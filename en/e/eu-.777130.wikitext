'''Eu-''' (Greek εὖ-, the combining form of the adjective ευς "good") is a prefix meaning "good, well". From [[PIE]] ''*hsu-'', it is cognate to [[Sanskrit]] ''su-'', [[Avestan]] ''hu-'', with the same meaning. 

In English, the prefix occurs mostly in words directly loaned from Greek, such as [[eulogy]], [[euphemism]], [[evangelist]], [[eucharist]], [[eucalyptus]], [[eudemonic]], [[euonymous]], [[euphoria]], [[eurhythmy]], [[euthanasia]], [[eutrophy]], but it has some productivity, combining with Greek loanwords that did not take the prefix in attested Greek, e.g. in [[eucaryote]], [[eugenic]], [[euchlorine]], [[Eutopia]].

Note that the ''Eu-'' in ''[[Europe]]'' is unrelated.

The antonymous prefix is '''[[dys-]]''' (δυσ-),  PIE ''*dus-'', Sanskrit ''dur-''. This prefix appears to be more productive for new coinages, thus ''dysangelical'' is a [[nonce]]-word expressing the opposite of "evangelical", or ''dyslogy'' expressing the opposite of ''eulogy''. It also frequently figures in  terms for illnesses and ailments, such as [[dysarthrosis]], [[dyslexia]] etc.
