<!-- commented out because the OED addition series just lists this as a sense without any problems. what does "strict usage" mean anyway?
====Usage notes====
In strict usage, ''eponym'' refers to the original name upon which a word is based, and not to the word derived from that name.  Ignoring capitalization issues, the term has also come to refer to the thing so named.
