===Etymology===
From {{der|de|goh|-}}. The first part has absorbed the tribal name [[Angle]], and an extended form of the god's name [[Ing]] (as in [[Ingela]]), and was in Christian times interpreted as {{m|de|Engel||an angel}}. The second part is {{m|goh|beraht||bright}}. Popularized by a martyred 13th century bishop of [[Cologne]].
