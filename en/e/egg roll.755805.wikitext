[[File:CookbookEggrollOpen.jpg|thumb|An '''egg roll''' ({{senseno|en|deepfried}}), torn open.]]
[[File:Love Letters (food).jpg|thumb|A bucket of '''egg rolls''' ({{senseno|en|biscuits}}).]]

===Etymology===
From {{af|en|egg|roll}}, modelled after {{m|en|spring roll}}. The use of ''egg'' in the name is probably because the words for ''spring'' and ''egg'' sound the same in Cantonese, as egg rolls usually contain no egg.

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{senseid|en|deepfried}}A food made made by wrapping a combination of chopped vegetables, possibly meat, and sometimes noodles, in a sheet of [[dough]], dipping the dough in egg or an egg wash, then [[deep frying]] it.
# {{senseid|en|biscuits}}In many Asian countries and among their emigrants, an egg-based, flute-shaped [[pastry]], with typically yellowish, flaky crust, often eaten as a sweet snack or [[dessert]]; a crispy biscuit roll.
# An African snack resembling a [[Scotch egg]].
# An instance of the [[egg rolling]] tradition.

====Usage notes====
* People who make a distinction often consider an egg roll to be larger and with a thicker skin than a [[spring roll]], but many use the terms interchangeably.
