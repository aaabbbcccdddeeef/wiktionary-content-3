# {{lb|en|finance}} A type of [[mortgage]] (typically a loan to buy a house) where, over the term of the loan, the [[borrower]]'s regular payments to the [[lender]] cover only the [[interest]] charged by the lender. At the same time, the borrower makes regular payments into a separate savings or investment plan. When this plan matures, the borrower uses the proceeds to repay the [[principal]] of the loan. Contrasted with '''[[repayment mortgage]]'''.
