'''equidistant'''

# occupying a position midway between two ends or sides
# occupying a position that is an equal distance between several [[point]]s.  Note that in a one-dimensional space this position can be identified with two points, in a two-dimensional space with three points (not on the same straight line), and in a three-dimensional space with four points (not in the same [[plane]]).
# {{cartography}} Describing a map [[projection]] that preserves [[scale]]. No map can show scale correctly throughout the entire map but some can show true scale between one or two points and every point or along every [[meridian]] and these are referred to as equidistant.
