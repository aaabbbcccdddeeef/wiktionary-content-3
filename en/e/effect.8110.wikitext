====Usage notes====
'''Effect''' is often confused with “'''[[affect]]'''”.  The latter is used to convey the influence over existing ideas, emotions and entities; the former indicates the manifestation of new or original ideas or entities:
* “...new governing coalitions have '''effected''' major changes” indicates that major changes were made as a result of new governing coalitions.
* “...new governing coalitions have '''affected''' major changes” indicates that before new governing coalitions, major changes were in place, and that the new governing coalitions had some influence over these existing changes.
