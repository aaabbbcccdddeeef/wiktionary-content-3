===Etymology===
From {{etyl|fr|en}} {{m|fr|épizootique}}, animal equivalent of [[epidemic]], from {{m|fr|épizootie}}, irregularly formed from {{etyl|grc|en}} {{m|grc|ἐπί}} + {{m|grc|ζῷον||animal}}.
{{affix|en|epi-|zo-|-otic}}. Use of the word in the second sense, "an ailment", was likely originally a reference to a particular epizootic ailment.<ref name="April 1873">'''1873''', J. S. Boone, in an article in ''The Medical and Surgical Reporter'', 5 April 1873, volume XXVIII, number 14, number 840, published in the compilation ''The Medical and Surgical Reporter'', volume XXVIII, page 278: Large numbers of persons were affected with the disease at the same time. It was not an unfrequent occurrence, in interchanging the compliments of the day with a friend, to receive, in response to an inquiry regarding his health, a reply similar to the following: "I have got the '''epizootic''';" or, "I am about past going with the 'zooty;'" or, "The horse disease is going hard with me."</ref><ref>'''1913''', ''American Journal of Veterinary Medicine'', November 1913, volume VIII, number 11, page 621: In the sparsely settled districts of Kansas, [...] there was recently a slight epizootic of a catarrhal nature among the horses, which is popularly known as "epizootic."</ref> Both senses are attested since at least the 1800s, and the pronunciation with five syllables is explicitly attested since then as well.<ref name="five syllables 1">'''1876''', William Cullen Bryant, in a letter to Leonice M.
