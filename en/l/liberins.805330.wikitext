Liberins, otherwise known as releasing factors, are hormones produced by the hypothalamus that travel down the hypothalamic pituitary axis, to the posterior pituitary and cause the release of the corresponding hormone. For example Thyroliberin causes release of TSH and Gonadoliberin causes the release of FSH and LH.

Statins are hypothalamic release inhibiting hormones/factors. For example prolactostatin inhibits the release of prolactin.
