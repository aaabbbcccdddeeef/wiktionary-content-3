{{was wotd|2006|March|26}}

===Etymology===
Borrowed from {{bor|en|frm|leger de main|lit=light of hand}}, a phrase that meant "dexterous, skillful at fooling others (especially through [[sleight of hand|sleights of hand]]"), which was however treated as a noun when it was borrowed by late Middle English. The Modern French descendant [[léger de main]] of the Middle French phrase is archaic and incomprehensible to most but still sometimes found in older literature (e.g. Morand, 1954).
