===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|legerdemeyn}}, {{m|enm|lechardemane}}, from {{der|en|fro|léger de main|lit=light of hand}}, a phrase that meant “dexterous, skillful at fooling others (especially through [[sleight of hand|sleights of hand]]”), which was however treated as a noun when it was borrowed by late Middle English. The Modern French descendant {{m|fr|léger de main}} of the Old French phrase is archaic and incomprehensible to most but still sometimes found in older literature and simply means “skillful” without any connotation of sleight of hand.

#*: Chief Justice Roberts does more or less the same thing in dissent: He practices intentions-and-expectations originalism while randomly sprinkling some public-meaning originalism fairy dust over his description of his enterprise, perhaps in the subconscious hope that no one will notice the '''legerdemain.'''
# A show of [[skill]] or [[deceitful]] [[ability]].
#* '''1673''', Gilbert Burnet, ''The mystery of iniquity unvailed'', London, p. 128:
