{{also|léger de main}}
==English==
{{was wotd|2006|March|26}}

===Etymology===
Borrowed from {{bor|en|frm|leger de main|lit=light of hand}}, a phrase that meant “dexterous, skillful at fooling others (especially through [[sleight of hand|sleights of hand]]”), which was however treated as a noun when it was borrowed by late Middle English. The Modern French descendant {{m|fr|léger de main}} of the Middle French phrase is archaic and incomprehensible to most but still sometimes found in older literature and simply means “skillful” without any connotation of sleight of hand.
