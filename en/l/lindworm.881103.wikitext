# {{lb|en|folklore and mythology}} A lindworm is a giant reptile-like beast often considered to be a draconic creature. The worm in lindworm refers to their usual snake-like appearance, for example Lambton worm. Lindworm's appearance can vary from tale to tale and from country to country; they may be just about anything a dragon can be depicted; they can be wingless, winged, quadrupedal, bipedal like wyverns, two-armed or completely limbless. They may have either a poisonous breath, a fiery breath or no breath at all. The most common depiction of lindworm is that of a beast with a long snake-like body like in Chinese dragons, a dragon-like head, scaled skin and two clawed arms in the upper body.
