{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|folklore and mythology}} A lindworm is a giant reptile-like beast often considered to be a draconic creature. The worm in lindworm refers to their usual snake-like appearance, for example [[Lambton worm]].
Lindworm's appearance can vary from tale to tale, they may be just about anything a dragon can be depicted; they can be wingless, winged, quadrupedal, bipedal like wyverns, two-armed or completely limbless.
The most common depiction of lindworm is that of a beast with a long snake-like body like in Chinese dragons, a dragon-like head, scaled skin and two clawed arms in the upper body.
# {{lb|en|fantasy}} Fantasy writers have their own depictions of lindworm, they may be true to the original myths as said above or they may be a product of author's imagination, some writers choose to name them lindwyrms instead of lindworms.
