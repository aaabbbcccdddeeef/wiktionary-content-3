===Etymology===
From: {{ME.}} ''line'' {{OE.}} ''līne'' (meaning: [[cable]], [[hawser]]); both probably from {{L.}} ''[[linea]]'' (meaning: a [[linen]] [[thread]], [[string]], line) and from ''[[linum]]'' (meaning: [[flax]], thread, linen, cable). The English word was influenced by the {{F.}} ''[[ligne]]'' (meaning: line) from the same Latin word linea.
