From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|line}}, {{m|enm|lyne}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|līne||line, cable, rope, hawser, series, row, rule, direction}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*līnǭ||line, rope, flaxen cord, thread}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{m|gem-pro|*līną||flax, linen}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*līno-||flax}}.

The oldest sense of the word is "rope, cord, thread"; from this the senses "path", "continuous mark" were derived.
