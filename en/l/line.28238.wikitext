===Etymology===
From:
# Old English ''line''
# Anglo-Saxon ''līne'' (meaning: [[cable]], [[hawser]])<br>

both probably from Latin ''[[linea]]'' (meaning: a [[linen]] [[thread]], [[string]], line) and from ''[[linum]]'' (meaning: [[flax]], thread, linen, cable)<br>

but the English word was influenced by the French ''[[ligne]]'' (meaning:  line) from the same Latin word linea.
