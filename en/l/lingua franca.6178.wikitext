====Usage notes====
On the plural form:  This phrase, being originally Italian, would have as its original plural {{term|lingue franche}}, which is rare but attested in English. The pedantic English plural would be {{term|linguas franca}}, as {{term|lingua||language}} is the head noun; similar words that pluralize on this pattern are {{term|son-in-law|sons-in-law}} and {{term|attorney general|attorneys general}}.  The most common plural in English, however, appears to be {{term|lingua francas}}. There is also a form {{term|linguae francae}} which adopts a Latinate reading of the term; this form is suggested in dictionaries alongside ''lingua francas,'' but also appears to be rare in English.
