===Etymology===
From Italian

===Noun===
'''[[lingua]] [[franca]]''' (''plural: see usage note'')

# A common language spoken in [[Mediterranean]] ports in centuries past (consisting of Italian mixed with French, Spanish, Arabic and some Greek words and used by sailors of different countries to communicate with one another).
# Any similar language used by people of diverse speech to communicate with one another, often a basic form of speech with simplified grammar.

====Usage notes====
On the plural form:  This phrase, being originally Italian, would have as its original plural ''[[lingue franche]],'' which is rare but attested in English. The pedantic English plural would be ''[[linguas franca]],'' as ''[[lingua]]'' ‘language’ is the head noun; similar words that pluralize on this pattern are [[son-in-law|sons-in-law]] and [[attorney general|attorneys general]].  The most common plural in English, however, appears to be ''[[lingua francas]].'' There is also a form ''[[linguae francae]]'' which adopts a Latinate reading of the term; this form is suggested in dictionaries alongside ''lingua francas,'' but also appears to be rare in English.
