===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm}} {{term|luk|lang=enm}}, {{term|lukke|lang=enm}}, related to {{etyl|ofs|-}} {{term|luk||luck|lang=ofs}}, {{etyl|fy|-}} {{term|gelok||luck|lang=fy}}, {{etyl|nl|-}} {{term|geluk||luck|lang=nl}}, {{etyl|nds|-}} {{term|luk||luck|lang=nds}}, {{etyl|de|-}} {{term|Glück||luck, good fortune, happiness|lang=de}}, {{etyl|da|-}} {{term|lykke||luck|lang=da}}, {{etyl|sv|-}} {{term|lycka||luck|lang=sv}}, {{etyl|is|-}} {{term|lukka||luck|lang=is}}.

Loaned into English in the 15th century (probably as a gambling term) from  {{etyl|dum}}  {{term|luc|lang=dum}}, a shortened form of: {{term|gheluc||good fortune|lang=dum}} (whence Modern Dutch {{term|geluk|lang=nl}}).
Middle Dutch ''luc'', ''gheluc'' is paralleled by Middle High German ''lück, gelücke'' (modern  German {{term|Glück|lang=de}}). The word   occurs only from the 12th century, apparently first in Rhine Frankish. Perhaps from an Old Frankish  ''*galukki''. The word enters standard Middle High German during the 13th century, and spreads to English and Scandinavian in the Late Middle Ages. Its origin seems to have been regional or dialectal, and there were competing German words such as [[gevelle]] or [[schick]], or the Latinate [[fortune]]. Its etymology is unknown, although there are numerous proposals as to its derivations from a number of roots.

Use as a verb in American English is late (1940s), but there was a Middle English verb ''lukken'' "to chance, to happen by good fortune" in the 15th century.
