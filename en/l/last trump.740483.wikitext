===Etymology===
From the Bible, Paul's first letter to the Corinthians: "We shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump" ([[s:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#15:52|1 Corinthians 15:52]], [[KJV]]), referring to the last of seven trumpets to be sounded at the [[Last Judgement]]. The term used for the instrument in the original Koine Greek is {{m|grc|σάλπιγξ}}, often translated as “war-trumpet”, but not resembling the modern instrument (see {{w|Seven trumpets}} on Wikipedia).
