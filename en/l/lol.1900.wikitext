    Today I was walking down the street with my friends at about 12:30 AM, and a cop stopped to talk to us. Apparently someone was out slashing tires that night, so he wanted to see if we had any knives or anything.

    Earlier today someone from school gave me a big, pink screw, which fit into a knife box that he also gave me. I thought it was pretty cool. Anyway, when the cop asked for us to pull out any knives we had, I pulled out the knife box containing the screw instead of the pocket knife I was carrying. As soon as I handed the box to him I realized that I had just handed him a big, pink screw in a box after saying "yeah, I have a knife." Completely on impulse, as soon as he opened the box to see the screw, I yelled "Screw you! AHAHA!!" and ran as fast as I could.


    I was charged with harassing a police officer, but it was completely worth it.
