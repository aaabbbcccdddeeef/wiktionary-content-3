Lol is pie. It is true. It originated in mars in 2036 and travelled back in time to stop people from wasting time writing out "laughing out loud". Because people wrote "laughing ot loud" instead of "lol" they used very much time on chatting rather than developing. In 2036 the had just only invented the toaster because of the wasted time saying "laughing ot loud".
