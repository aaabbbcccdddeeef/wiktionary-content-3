===Etymology===
Acronym from English [[LOL]] for "laughing out loud", "lots of love" or "lots of laughs." Said to have first been used by Californian boy Joey Thorpe when he was ten years old. According to a TIMES article printed after the popularity of the slang term grew substantially in May of 1998, Joey claims that he originally used the term because he could no longer hold in his laughter while talking to "nerds" in AOL chat rooms.
