# One's [[family name]]; [[surname]].

====Usage notes====
* A '''last name''' is so called because it is in English written last, after the [[given name]]s. However, in many other languages and cultures this name precedes the given name; in these cases, the terms {{mention|en|surname}} or {{mention|en|family name}} are more appropriate.
* The term '''last name''' is more common in the United States, '''surname''' in the British Isles.
