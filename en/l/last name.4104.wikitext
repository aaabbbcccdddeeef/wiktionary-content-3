# One's [[family name]]; [[surname]].

====Usage notes====
* A '''last name''' is so called because it is in English written last, after the [[given name]]s. However, in many other languages and cultures this name precedes the given name; in these cases, the terms ''surname'' or ''family name'' are more appropriate.

====Synonyms====
* {{l|en|family name}}, {{l|en|surname}}
* See also [[Thesaurus:surname]]
