{{also|Libertarian}}
==English==

===Etymology===
1789 {{suffix|liberty|arian}}
{{rel-top|sense changes}}
{{term|libertaire||anarchist|lang=fr}} formed from {{term|liberté||freedom|lang=fr}}, from Latin {{term|libertas|lang=la}} and the suffix {{term|-aire|lang=fr}}, from Latin {{term|-arius|lang=la}}.

First appeared in English in 1789 by [[w:William Belsham|William Belsham]], in his ''[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=fg4WAAAAYAAJ Essays].'' This was contrasted with [[necessitarian]], in the context of [[w:free will|free will]], and was not used in the current sense.

The French word is first attested in a letter in May 1857 by French 
[[w:Anarchist communism|anarcho-communist]] [[w:Joseph Déjacque|Joseph Déjacque]] to anarchist philosopher [[w:Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], reading:<ref>[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle: Lettre à P.J. Proudhon]</ref>
:“Anarchiste juste-milieu, libéral et non LIBERTAIRE…”
In translation:
:“A centrist anarchist, liberal and not LIBERTARIAN…”
hence the sense is of “extreme [[left-wing]]”.

The French term was popularized as a euphemism for [[anarchist]] in the 1890s, following the [[w:lois scélérates|lois scélérates]], when anarchist publications were banned by law in France.

The sense of “pro-property individualist” developed in the US in the 1940s, and was popularized in the 1950s. In the 1940s, [[w:Leonard Read|Leonard Read]] began calling himself “libertarian” to contrast with “classical liberal”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertarianism.org/ex-3.html|title=A Note on Labels: Why "Libertarian"?}}</ref> In 1955, [[w:Dean Russell|Dean Russell]] also promoted use of the word, writing: “Let those of us who love liberty trademark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word ‘libertarian’.”<ref>Dean Russell, [http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/politics/name.html ''Who is a Libertarian?''], [[Foundation for Economic Education]], "Ideas on Liberty," May, 1955.</ref>
