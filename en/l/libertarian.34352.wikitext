{{also|Libertarian}}
==English==

===Etymology===
From French ''[[libertaire]]'' ("[[anarchist]]"), formed from ''[[liberté]]'' ("freedom", from Latin ''libertas'') and the suffix ''-aire'' (from Latin ''-arius'').

N.B. The French term was coined when anarchist publications were banned by law in France.  The anarchists invented the synonym ''libertaire'' in order to skirt the ban.

Pro-property individualists later adopted the phrase. In the 1940s, [[Leonard Read]] began calling himself "libertarian" to contrast with "classical liberal."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertarianism.org/ex-3.html|title=A Note on Labels: Why "Libertarian"?}}</ref> In 1955, [[Dean Russell]] also promoted use of the word, writing: "Let those of us who love liberty trademark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word "libertarian."<ref>Dean Russell, [http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/politics/name.html ''Who is a Libertarian?''], [[Foundation for Economic Education]], "Ideas on Liberty," May, 1955.</ref>
