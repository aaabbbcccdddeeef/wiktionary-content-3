#*: So I do think that there is a wonderful opportunity for us to find a carbon-neutral energy source where it is not only a beneficial model environmentally but we are sort of becoming forest and energy '''locavores''', if you will, and so that is what we are trying to establish through this idea of a community wood energy program where we would be using, you know, town forests to actually supply town energy needs so that people can actually see the costs and the impacts of where their energy is coming from.

====Usage notes====
* The variant {{term||localvore}} is also attested:
** '''2007,''' Rebecca Kneale Gould, "Binding Life to Values", in Jonathan Isham and Sissel A. Waage (eds.), ''Ignition: What You Can Do to Fight Global Warming and Spark a Movement'',<sup>[http://books.google.com/books?id=26Wa_pUG6HkC]</sup> Island Press, ISBN 1597261564, page 123,
**: The idea of eco-kosher both draws on and contributes to organic, slow food, and “'''localvore'''” movements, but it grounds these ideas in an ancient tradition that has always understood eating to be a sacred act that must support the principles of the flourishing of life and the establishment of justice.
