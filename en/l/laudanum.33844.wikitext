===Etymology===
From {{der|en|NL.|-}}, from {{der|en|la|laudō|t=I praise}}, or {{m|la|ladanum|t=a gum resin}}, from {{der|en|grc|λάδανον}}. Originally the same word as {{m|en|ladanum}}, {{m|en|labdanum}}, compare {{cog|fr|laudanum}}, {{cog|it|laudano}}, {{m|it|ladano}}. See {{m|en|ladanum}}.

Used by [[w:Paracelsus|Paracelsus]] to refer to ladanum gum, and to a compound recipe containing pearls, but apparently not to any preparation of opium; this modern sense was introduced by his followers (Sigerist 1941:540–1).
