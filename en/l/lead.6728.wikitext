===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|led}}, {{m|enm|leed}}, from {{inh|en|ang|lēad||lead}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*laudą||lead}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*lewdʰ-||lead}}. Cognate with {{cog|sco|leid}}, {{m|sco|lede||lead}}, {{cog|frr|lud}}, {{m|frr|luad||lead}}, {{cog|fy|lead||lead}}, {{cog|nl|lood||lead}}, {{cog|de|Lot||solder, plummet, sounding line}}, {{cog|sv|lod||lead}}, {{cog|is|lóð||a plumb, weight}}, {{cog|ga|luaidhe||lead}}.

Alternative etymology suggests the possibility that Proto-Germanic *''laudą'' may derive from {{etyl|cel-pro|en}} {{m|cel-pro|*loudom}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*plow(d)-||to flow}}. If so, then cognate with {{cog|la|plumbum||lead}}. Cognate with {{cog|de|leiten||to lead, manage, conduct}}. More at {{l|en|flow}}.
