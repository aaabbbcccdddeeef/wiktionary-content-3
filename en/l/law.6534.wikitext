===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*legʰ-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|lawe}}, {{m|enm|laȝe}}, from {{inh|en|ang|lagu|t=law}}, from {{der|en|non|lǫg|t=law|lit=things laid down or fixed}}, originally the plural of {{m|non|lag||layer, stratum, a laying in order, measure, stroke}}, from {{der|en|gem-pro|*lagą|t=that which is laid down}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*legʰ-|t=to lie}}. Cognate with {{cog|is|lög|t=things laid down, law}}, {{cog|sv|lag|t=law}}, {{cog|da|lov|t=law}}. Replaced {{noncog|ang|ǣ}} and {{m|ang|ġesetnes}}. More at {{l|en|lay}}. Unrelated to French {{m|fr|loi}} nor Spanish [[ley]], since they both derive from {{m|ine-pro|*leǵ-||to gather}}.
