My father's family name was Lissauer.  My grandfather, great-grandfather and their wives and children all came to the United States with that surname.  My grandfather and great-grandfather for some reason known only to themselves changed it to Lesser after coming to New York City.  I have many relatives with either the Lissauer or Lesser surname.
