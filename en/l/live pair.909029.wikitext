# {{lb|en|US|politics}} Two members of [[Congress]] who would have otherwise cast opposing votes, but who form an agreement whereby one announces the couple is a live pair and registers his or her own vote as [[present]] rather than for or against. Although not recognized or recorded in vote tallies, the effect is to allow the other member to be absent without affecting the outcome of the vote.
