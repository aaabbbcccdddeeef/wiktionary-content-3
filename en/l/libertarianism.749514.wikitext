{{en-noun}}
# A political philosophy maintaining that all persons are the absolute owners of their own lives, and should be free to do whatever they wish with their persons or property, provided they allow others the same liberty.
Right-libertarians hold that the resources "may be appropriated by the first person who discovers them, mixes labor with them, or merely claims themâ€”without the consent of others, and with little or no payment to them." Left-libertarians hold "that unappropriated natural resources belong to everyone in some egalitarian manner."
