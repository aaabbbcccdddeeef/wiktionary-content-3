'''Linkman''': A term used in the sport of rugby union to describe a player who uses his speed, dexterity and rugby intelligence to keep an attacking team's downfield progress fluid.<br />
Auckland openside flanker '''Daniel Braid''' is perhaps the finest exponent of LINKMAN play currently on display in New Zealand rugby's national championship, The Air New Zealand Cup.
