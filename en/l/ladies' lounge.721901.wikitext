{{en-noun|sg=[[ladies]]' [[lounge]]}}
# {{Australia}} A type of room in a [[pub]] or [[hotel]] for drinking in.  Originally established for women to drink in when licensing laws in most states of Australia didn't permit them to be served in the [[public bar]], and remaining after that time as more genteel areas than the traditionally male-oriented public bar.
