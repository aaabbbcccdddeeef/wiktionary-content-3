A '''Linguanaut''' is someone who is passionate about [[language]]s, a surfer in the ocean of languages. The word came from Latin: [lingua: language + nauticus: sailor].
The word rhymes just like astronaut, an Astronaut has a passion for the outer space, and a linguanaut has a passion for the world of languages.
