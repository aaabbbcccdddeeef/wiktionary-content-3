{{en-proper noun}}

# Federal territory in eastern [[Malaysia]] which has [[Victoria]] as its main town.

The name '''Labuan''' simply means "port", "anchorage", or "harbour" in Malay and Indonesian languages.
It is common in these languages to simply call a place labuan without giving a corresponding name.  Thus, it is quite possible there are hundreds of places called labuan.  Its origin is related to the Filipino word ''taguan'' (refuge).
