"'''Live by the sword, die by the sword'''" is a [[metaphor]]ical expression meaning that living one's life in a certain way will, in the end, affect one's destiny. The proverb comes from the [[Book of Matthew]], verse 26:52, which describes the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] drawing a sword to defend [[Jesus]] against [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] soldiers, but is told to sheath the weapon:

{{quote|Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.|Matthew 26:52}}

While the expression literally means “those who live by violence you will die by violence”, it is also used for a variety of situations which contain an element of [[poetic justice]]. For instance the proverb could be used to describe a person who regularly drives [[Driving under the influence|under the influence]] and is ultimately killed in a vehicle accident caused by their intoxication. Other variants on this phrase are also commonly used.
