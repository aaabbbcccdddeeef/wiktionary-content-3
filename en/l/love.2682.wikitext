* {{a|RP|GA}} {{IPA|en|/lʌv/|[ɫʌv]}}

===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*lewbʰ-|id=love}}
From {{inh|en|enm|love}}, {{m|enm|luve}}, from {{inh|en|ang|lufu}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*lubu}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*lubō}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*lewbʰ-|t=love, care, desire}}.

The close-of-a-letter sense is presumably a truncation of ''With love'' or the like.

The verb is from {{inh|en|enm|loven}}, {{m|enm|luvien}}, from {{inh|en|ang|lufian|t=to love}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*lubōn|t=to love}}, derived from the noun.

Eclipsed non-native {{noncog|en|amour|t=love}}, borrowed from {{noncog|fr|amour|t=love}}.

Cognates include {{cog|ru|любовь}}, {{cog|pl|lubić}} and {{cog|sa|लोभ||desire, greed}}.

===Etymology 2===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*lewbʰ-|id=love}}

===Etymology 3===
