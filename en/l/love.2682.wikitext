===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*lewbʰ-|id=love}}
From {{inh|en|enm|love}}, {{m|enm|luve}}, from {{inh|en|ang|lufu}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*lubu}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*lubō}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*lewbʰ-|t=love, care, desire}}.

The close-of-a-letter sense is presumably a truncation of ''With love'' or the like.

The verb is from {{inh|en|enm|loven}}, {{m|enm|luvien}}, from {{inh|en|ang|lufian|t=to love}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*lubōn|t=to love}}, derived from the noun.

Eclipsed non-native {{noncog|en|amour|t=love}}, borrowed from {{noncog|fr|amour|t=love}}.

Cognates include {{cog|ru|любовь}}, {{cog|pl|lubić}} and {{cog|sa|लोभ||desire, greed}}.

===Etymology 2===
Now widely believed (due to historical written record) to be from the idea that when one does a thing “for love”, that is for no monetary gain, the word “love” implying "nothing". 

The former assumption that it had originated from French {{m|fr|œuf|l’œuf|lit=the egg}}, due to its shape, has largely been discredited and is no longer widely accepted. 

Needless to say, the apparent similarity of the shape of an egg to a zero has inspired similar analogies, such as the use of {{m|en|duck}} (reputed to be short for duck's egg) for a zero score at cricket, and {{m|en|goose egg}} for "zero". 

====Noun====
{{en-noun|-}}

# {{lb|en|racquet sports|billiards}} [[zero|Zero]], no score.
#: ''So that’s fifteen-'''love''' to Kournikova.''
#* '''2013''', {{w|Paul McNamee}}, ''Game Changer: My Tennis Life''
#*: The next day [[w:Andre Agassi|Agassi]] came back from two sets to '''love''' down to beat Courier in five sets.
# Nothing; no recompense. <!--see Hotten's Slang Dictionary 1873-->
#* '''1916''', H. Rider Haggard, ''The Ivory Child''
#*: I fought the white man for less than sixpence. I fought him for '''love''', which is nothing at all.
