#* '''2003''', Rob Rachowiecki & al., ''Ecuador and the Galápagos Islands'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=4KQbiA1T-MEC&pg=PA44 page 44]:
#*: People needing to use the '''lavatory''' often ask to use the ''baño'' in a restaurant; toilet paper is rarely available, so the experienced traveler always carries a personal supply.
# A [[fixture]] for [[washing]] [[hand]]s: a [[sink]].
#* '''2005''', Michael W. Litchfield, ''Renovation'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=CPZQYiuX-W0C&pg=PA325 page 325]:
#*: '''Lavatories''' (bathroom sinks) are available in a blizzard of colors, materials, and styles.
#* '''2010''', Chris Peterson, ''Black & Decker: The Complete Guide to Bathrooms'', 3rd ed., [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=vPxIRYtCMxkC&pg=PA162 page 162]:
#*: If your '''lavatory''' doesn′t have a predrilled flange, the great advantage to the widespread configuration is that you gain flexibility in locating your spout and handles (probably a bigger advantage for tubs than for lavatories).
#* '''2011''', Sharon Koomen Harmon & al., ''The Codes Guidebook for Interiors'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BdT-tAR_afAC&pg=PA288 page 288]：
#*: Anywhere a water closet is used, a '''lavatory''' (ie, hand-washing sink) must also be installed.
# {{label|en|UK|New England}} A [[fixture]] for [[urination]] and [[defecation]]: a [[toilet]].
#* '''1997''', [[w:Slavoj Žižek|Slavoj Žižek]], ''The Plague of Fantasies'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=NM5PqgKd2dsC&pg=PA4 page 4],
#*: In a traditional German '''lavatory''', the hole in which shit disappears after we flush water is way in front, so that the shit is first laid out for us to sniff at and inspect for traces of some illness; in the typical French '''lavatory''', on the contrary, the hole is in the back - that is, the shit is supposed to disappear as soon as possible; finally, the Anglo-Saxon (English or American) '''lavatory''' presents a kind of synthesis, a mediation between these two opposed poles - the basin is full of water so that the shit floats in it - visible, but not to be inspected.
