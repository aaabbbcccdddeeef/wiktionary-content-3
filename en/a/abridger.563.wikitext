#* {{RQ:Austen Northanger Abbey||5|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/121/121-h/121-h.htm|text={{...}} while the abilities of the nine-hundredth '''abridger''' of the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens—there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them.}}
#* '''1985''', {{w|Carol Shields}}, “Accidents” in ''The Collected Stories'', Random House Canada, 2004, p.{{nbsp}}47,
#*: I am an '''abridger'''. When I tell people, at a party for instance, that I am an '''abridger''', their faces cloud with confusion and I always have to explain. What I do is take the written work of other people and compress it.
