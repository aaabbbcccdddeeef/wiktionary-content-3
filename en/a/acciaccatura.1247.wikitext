===Noun===
{{en-noun|s|acciaccature}}

# {{lb|en|music}} A short [[grace note]] (theoretically taking no time at all), occurring on the beat occupied by the main note to which it is prefixed, one scale-step higher or lower than that main note. (Sometimes equivalent, therefore, to a short ''[[appoggiatura]]'', but in Baroque music interpreted differently and more strictly.) Written as a note lighter in appearance, typically a quaver (eighth note), with an oblique stroke through the stem.
