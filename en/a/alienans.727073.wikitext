An '''alienans''' is an adjective which negates or denies the following phrase, but gives the appearance of being a qualifier. For example a "decoy duck" is not a duck - in this context, "decoy" is an alienans. Contrast this to a "brown duck", a duck which is brown. In this context, "brown" is ''not'' an alienans.
