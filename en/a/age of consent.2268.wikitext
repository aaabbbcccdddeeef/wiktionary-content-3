===Noun===
'''[[age]] [[of]] [[consent]]'''

# {{legal}} The age at which a [[person]] is [[legally]] considered to be mature enough to engage [[willingly]] in [[sexual intercourse]].
Note: The term is used to indicate the age at which it is no longer a crime for ''someone else'' to engage in [[consensual]] sexual intercourse with the person who is still younger than the age of [[consent]], as they are considered statutorily a victim of a crime, because by law they are considered incapable of giving [[permission]] to someone else to engage in sexual intercourse with them.
