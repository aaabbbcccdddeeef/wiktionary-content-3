====Conjugation====
{{la-conj|irreg|aiō}}

====Usage notes====
* Often written ''āiō'', etc. with long ''ā'' before consonantal ''i'', even though the ''a'' was in fact pronounced short. The reason for this is that the morpheme-internal consonantal ''i'' is regularly pronounced double, making the syllable long by position, and the macron is an attempt to indicate that.
* This was represented in spelling by some, but avoided by others since it could lead to multiplication of the letter ''I''. Cicero, for instance, is said to have written ''AIIO'', ''AIIUNT'', ''AIIEBANT'', as well as ''MAIIOR'' ({{m|la|maior}}), ''EIIUS'' ({{m|la|eius}}), etc. Other writers and makers of inscriptions used the ''ī longa'' (tall I), e.g. ''AꟾO'', ''EꟾUS'', or even a combination ''AIꟾO'', ''EIꟾUS''.
* 3rd-person singular ''ait'', the most common form, is normally attested as a disyllabic with two light syllables, that is [ˈa.ɪt], not [ˈaj.jɪt] with a first heavy syllable.
* Forms with long ''ī'', including before final ''t'', can be found in Plautus, e.g. ''aīs'', ''aīt''.
* Also in Plautus can be found diphthongal forms such as ''a͡is'' (one syllable), ''a͡it'' (one syllable), ''a͡ibam''/''a͡ibās''/''a͡ibāt'' (two syllables), etc.
* ''ait'' is also used in past narration; through its reinterpretation as a perfect-tense form, ''aistī'' is found post-Classically.
