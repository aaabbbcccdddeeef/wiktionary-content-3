# {{lb|en|zoology|acarology}} Any member of the [[subclass]] [[Acari]] (aka [[Acarina]]): thus, a [[mite]] or a [[tick]]; specifically, any mite of the [[genus]] ''[[Acarus]]''.

#* '''1868''', Robert Niccol, ''The Sugar Insect, "Acarus Sacchari", Found in Raw Sugar'', [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kegOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA4&dq=%22acarus%22%7C%22acari%22%7C%22acarina%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiMjOaF0_LqAhVKOisKHW94BLYQ6AEwAXoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=%22acarus%22%7C%22acari%22%7C%22acarina%22&f=false page 4],
#*: The number of '''''Acari''''' found in raw sugar is sometimes exceedingly great, and in no instance is the article quite free from either the insects or their ova (eggs).

Katsambas, ''European Handbook of Dermatological Treatments'', Springer, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=BXmpcf70a3oC&pg=PA342&dq=%22acarus%22%7C%22acari%22%7C%22acarina%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiMjOaF0_LqAhVKOisKHW94BLYQ6AEwJ3oECEQQAg#v=onepage&q=%22acarus%22%7C%22acari%22%7C%22acarina%22&f=false page 342],
#*: Besides the '''acarus''' of human scabies (''Sarcoptes scabiei hominis'') (0.3-0.5 mm), many other '''acari''' which are parasitic on animals or which infest various plant species, foods, organic waste or soil may occasionally attack man (facultative parasitism vs. obligatory parasitism in the case of scabies).

====Usage notes====
* The term and its two plural forms match, and are potentially confounded with, three different taxonomic names for two related [[taxa]]: genus ''[[Acarus]]'' ({{w|Linnaeus}}, 1758) and subclass [[Acari]] (Nitzsch), 1818), aka [[Acarina]]. The subclass comprises all [[mite]]s and [[tick]]s, while the genus is a particular group of mites. Further complicating matters, the genus ''[[Acarus]]'' as originally described by Linnaeus included a wide assortment of species. As new genera were described and species moved to them, the definition of the genus changed each time.
