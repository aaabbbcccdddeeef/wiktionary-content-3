===Etymology===
From a Native American village near present-day Tallahassee, Florida transcribed in Spanish as Apalchen or Apalachen [a.paˈla.tʃɛn]. The name was eventually used as for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. Now spelled "Appalachian", it is the fourth oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S. After the de Soto expedition in 1540, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves.
