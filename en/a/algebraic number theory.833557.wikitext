===Etymology===
{{blend|en|algebraic number|number theory}}. Possibly (alternatively or also) a [[calque]] of German {{m|de|algebraische Zahlentheorie}}.

===Noun===
{{en-noun|-|head=[[algebraic]] [[number theory]]}}
# {{lb|en|mathematics|number theory}} The branch of [[number theory]] in which number-theoretic questions are expressed in terms of properties of [[algebraic number field]]s or related objects, and studied using techniques from [[algebra]].
#* '''1998''', Norbert Klingen, ''Arithmetical Similarities: Prime Decomposition and Finite Group Theory'', {{w|Oxford University Press}} (Clarendon Press), [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oYzCGKGeni8C&pg=PA241&dq=%22algebraic+number+theory%22%7C%22algebraic+number+theories%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmtZWDusPdAhXGXLwKHZLqArcQ6AEIiAQwVA#v=onepage&q=%22algebraic%20number%20theory%22%7C%22algebraic%20number%20theories%22&f=false page 241],
#*: As is well-known in '''algebraic number theory''', there is a far-reaching analogy between number fields and algebraic function fields in one variable with finite constant field.

Weintraub, ''Factorization: Unique and Otherwise'', CRC Press, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3FTkCLl3ZlcC&pg=PA143&dq=%22algebraic+number+theory%22%7C%22algebraic+number+theories%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmtZWDusPdAhXGXLwKHZLqArcQ6AEIrwMwRQ#v=onepage&q=%22algebraic%20number%20theory%22%7C%22algebraic%20number%20theories%22&f=false page 143],
#*: The field of mathematics that these generalize to is known as '''''algebraic number theory'''''. As a matter of historical fact, our development here parallels the development of '''algebraic number theory'''.

#*: Elementary arithmetic studies divisibility and factorization of ordinary integers, '''Algebraic number theory''' considers the same questions for algebraic numbers, solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients. In this setting, (un)fortunately, the uniqueness of prime factorization no longer holds. Remedying and measuring its failure is the starting point of '''algebraic number theory'''.
