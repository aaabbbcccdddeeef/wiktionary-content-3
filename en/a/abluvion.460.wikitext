Several considerable lots have been washed away from the Hadley shore within sixty or seventy years and tracts equally large have been added to the Hatfield shore. It cannot be wondered at that this process of alluvion and '''abluvion''' which has gone on ever since the deluge or perhaps more correctly ever since Connecticut river broke down the ancient mound between Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke should produce even greater changes than these.}}
