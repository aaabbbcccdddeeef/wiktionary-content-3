This is the most ridiculous "encyclopedia" ever.  Anyone can post to this online trash collection.  There is no verification to ensure accuracy, much less any attention to contextuality or precision.  Any idiot can post whatever they want and there is no check on it.  Anyone who considers the definitions or articles on this site credible is as stupid as the page's designers.  I'm Rick James, Bitch.
