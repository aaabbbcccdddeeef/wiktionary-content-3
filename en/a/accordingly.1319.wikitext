#* {{quote-book|lang=en|year=1895|author=H. G. Wells|title=The Time Machine|chapter=X|passage=Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a strange, and for me, a most fortunate thing. Yet oddly enough I found here a far more unlikely substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that, by chance, I supposed had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first the stuff was paraffin wax, and smashed the jar '''accordingly'''. But the odor of camphor was unmistakable.}}

====Usage notes====
Synonym notes:
* ''Consequently'', indicates a connection between two things, the latter of which is done on account of the former.
* ''Accordingly'' marks the connection as one of simple accordance or [[congruity]], leading naturally to the result which followed; as, he was absent when I called, and I ''accordingly'' left my card; our preparations were all finished, and we ''accordingly'' set sail. ''Consequently'' all finished, and we ''accordingly'' set sail.
* ''Consequently'' marks a [[closer]] connection, that of [[logical]] or [[causal]] sequence; as, the papers were not ready, and ''consequently'' could not be signed.
