====Usage notes====
When referring to a person, '''accustomed''' is only used [[predicative]]ly; when referring to a thing, it is only used [[attributive]]ly. The use of the infinitive following '''accustomed''' (e.g. ''accustomed '''to do''''') is obsolete; in contemporary English, the [[gerund]] is used in this context (e.g. ''accustomed '''to doing''''').
