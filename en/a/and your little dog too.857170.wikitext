==English==
===Etymology===
From ''The Wizard of Oz''. Derived from a line by the Wicked Witch of the West in reference to the fact that Dorothy was under the protection of the Good Witch of the North but only for the moment: "I'll get you [[my pretty]], and your little dog too!" The dog in question was Toto, Dorothy's terrier; as a metaphor for Dorothy's "real" world, this refers to the fact that the Wicked Witch is a personification of Elmira Gulch, who wanted to have Toto put down for biting her on the leg, hence the co-conspirator context.

===Phrase===
{{infl|en|phrase|head=[[and]] [[your]] [[little]] [[dog]] [[too]]}}
# A statement that not only will the person being addressed be punished but their conspirators will also.
