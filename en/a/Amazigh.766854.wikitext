{{also|amazigh}}
==English==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|tzm|ar}} {{m|tzm|ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖ}}. From the active participle {{m|tzm|ⴰⵎ}} and {{m|tzm|ⴰⵣⵉⵖ}} a currently unattested word in [[Tamazight]]. Historically Amazigh was identified as meaning “free-man” with suggested connections to "aze" ("to be strong" in Taznatit), or "jeɣeɣ" ("to be brave" in Tamasheq).

With the regular sound change of [[Tamazight]] [[ɣ]] → Semitic [[k]], [[q]]; the corresponding root in [[Semitic]], a fellow [[Afro-Asiatic]] language, is {{ar-root|ز|ك|و}}, which does have the meaning of free, to be purified from excess, to dispense of filth or materials, to improve, to free something of inefficiencies, to shed its burdens, to not be bogged down.<ref name="Lane">“زكو” in Edward William Lane (1863), Arabic-English Lexicon, London: Williams & Norgate, pages 1240-1241, meaning to purify, to increase or improve, to allow to thrive or move freely.</ref>
