#* {{quote-book|year=1858 |title=Martial and the Moderns |author=Andrew Amos |page=285 |passage=Ceispinus did not heed to whom he gave his Tyrian '''abolla''' (cloak used at suppers) when he changed his dress, and resumed his toga. Whoever has got it, we pray thee, restore it to its proper shoulders. It is not Crispinus, but his '''abolla''' requires this of thee; for it is not every one to whom a dress dyed with purple is suitable; that colour is excluseively appropriated to luxury. If thou art addicted to theft, and feelest a craving thirst for gain, take a toga, not an '''abolla'''; there will be less danger of detection. }}
