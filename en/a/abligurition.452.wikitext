Truly, anamnestic of Byron’s “dura illia messorum!”

#*: “Your dad says it’s because I remember things better than other people on account of how I pay very close attention and care very much.”<br/>“Why?”<br/>“Because it is important to know things. For an example, I just recently learned that Roman Emperor Vitellius once ate one thousand oysters in one day, which is a very impressive act of '''''abligurition''''',” he said, using a word he felt sure Katherine wouldn’t know.
