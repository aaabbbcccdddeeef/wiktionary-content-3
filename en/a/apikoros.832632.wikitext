===Etymology===
From {{etyl|he}} {{term|אפיקורס|אֶפִּיקוֹרוֹס|heretic|tr='eppiqóros|sc=Hebr}}, from אפקרסותא (heresy).  From the root פקר ('to break out') with a formative ס (compare אפקרסין 'undergarments' from פקר in the sense of 'undress').  Phonetically coincidental with {{etyl|grc}} {{term|᾽Επίκουρος||[[Epicurus]]|tr=Epíkouros|sc=polytonic}}, the name of the ancient Greek philosopher who founded [[Epicureanism]] - this similarity probably contributed significantly to the popularity of the term in rabbinic literature.<ref>M.
