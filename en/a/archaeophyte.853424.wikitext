From {{confix|en|archaeo|pos1={{glossary|prefix}} meaning ‘ancient; early’|phyte|pos2={{glossary|suffix}} meaning ‘a plant that grows in a specified habitat’}}. {{m|en||Archaeo-}} is derived from {{der|en|grc|ἀρχαῖος|t=ancient, primeval}}, from {{m|grc|ᾰ̓ρχή|t=beginning, origin}} (from {{m|grc|ἄρχω|t=to begin; to command, rule}} (from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h₂ergʰ-|t=to begin; to command, rule}}) + {{m|grc|-η|pos=suffix forming {{glossary|verbal noun}}s}}) + {{m|grc|-ῐος|pos=suffix forming {{glossary|adjective}}s}}; while {{m|en||-phyte}} is from {{der|en|grc|φῠτόν|t=plant; tree}}, from {{m|grc|φῠ́ω|t=to arise, grow, spring up}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*bʰuH-|t=to appear, become; to grow}}) + {{m|grc|-ον|pos=suffix forming {{glossary|noun}}s}}.
