 | passage = Naturalists arrange the Mollusca in six classes, named ''Cephalopoda'', ''Pteropoda'', ''Gasteropoda'', ''Conchifera'', ''Brachiopoda'', and ''Tunicata''. Of these the first three are sometimes distinguished as ''[[Encephala]]'', or furnished with a head; the last three as '''''Acephala''''', being destitute of that organ.
