In the field of [[sexology]], '''anaclitism''' involves deriving adult [[sexual arousal]] from objects that one was exposed to as an infant. {{Fact|date=March 2007}} The [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] value often stems from tactile stimulation similar to that experienced by the infant before it could see well.

Anaclitism is closely related to [[diaper fetishism]] and [[infantilism]], also known by the terms [[adult baby]]ism and [[autonepiophilia]].

In Freudian theory, by contrast, anaclitic (or anaclisis) refers to the relation between bodily functions in early childhood and the later development of the sexual instinct.  The infant's bodily function of simple hunger and suckling at the breast, to take a primary example, is at first attached directly to the mother's breast.  After breastfeeding is no longer a part of the child's life, however, "the need for repeating the sexual satisfaction...becomes detached from the need for taking nourishment" and the sexual instinct becomes auto-erotic.(Laplanche and Pontalis 30, 1973).  Thus, following Freud, we can speak of the sexual instincts functioning in anaclisis with the human subject's first needs of self-preservation.
