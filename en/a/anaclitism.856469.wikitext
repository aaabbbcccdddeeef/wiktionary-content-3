In the field of [[sexology]], '''anaclitism''' involves deriving adult [[sexual arousal]] from objects that one was exposed to as an infant. {{citation needed|March 2007}} The [[Sexual fetishismfetish]] value often stems from tactile stimulation similar to that experienced by the infant before it could see well.

Anaclitism is closely related to [[diaper fetishism]] and [[infantilism]], also known by the terms [[adult baby]]ism and [[autonepiophilia]].
