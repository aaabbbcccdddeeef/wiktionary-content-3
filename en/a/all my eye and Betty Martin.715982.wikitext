==English==

===Etymology===
In Britain during the 1700s, the phrase was a common claim of dismissal (similar to 'nonsense', or 'hogwash'), or a way to declare disbelief of an absurdity.  The phrase possibly originated as the punch line of a joke.  Most variations of the joke involve a British sailor visiting Italy.  He overhears a Latin prayer, "Ah! mihi, bea’te Martine" (which translates to "Ah! Grant to me, blessed Martin", referring to St. Martin).  The sailor misheard the prayer, and later used the phrase as "All my eye and Betty Martin". Compare this with: In the past military orders had to be sent by radio. The radio operator would listen to a command and then repeat what he had misheard: e.g.“Send reinforcements; we’re going to advance” became “Send three and fourpence; we’re going to a dance”.
