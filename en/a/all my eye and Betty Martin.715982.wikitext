==English==

===Etymology===
In Britain during the 1700s, the phrase was a common claim of dismissal (similar to 'nonsense', or 'hogwash'), or a way to declare disbelief of an absurdity.  The phrase possibly originated as the punch line of a joke.  Most variations of the joke involve a British sailor visiting Italy.  He overhears a Latin prayer, "Ah! mihi, beaâ€™te Martine" (which translates to "Ah! Grant to me, blessed Martin", referring to St. Martin).  The sailor misheard the prayer, and later used the phrase as "All my eye and Betty Martin".
