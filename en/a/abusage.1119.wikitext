===Etymology===

'''Abusage''' first appeared in the 16th century as a general synonym of [[abuse]], but it fell into disuse after just a couple of centuries. The word reemerged in the language with a new grammar-specific sense after Eric Partridge published a book on grammar titled ''Usage and Abusage'' in 1942.
