#* {{quote-text|year=1871|author=James Anthony Froude|title=History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Death of Elizabeth|page=394|passage=The King of Navarre suddenly abandoned his party and went over to the Catholics. The explanation of his '''apostasy''' was as simple as it was base: Navarre had no confidence in the success of his cause, and he cared little in his heart for anything but women and vanity.}}
#* {{quote-text|year=1886|author={{w|Henry James}}|title=The Princess Casamassima|passage=What had he said, what had he done, after all, to give them the right to fasten on him the charge of '''apostasy'''? He had always been a free critic of everything, and it was natural that, on certain occasions, in the little parlour in Lisson Grove, he should have spoken in accordance with that freedom; but it was only with the Princess that he had permitted himself really to rail at the democracy and given the full measure of his scepticism.}}
# Specifically, the renunciation of one's [[religion]] or [[faith]].
