Ambonoclast, literally, "one who wishes to tear down screens" usually used to describe Architects or religious reforming authorities who want to carry out excess modernisation in churches. In medieval churches, the chancel (priests area) was separated from nave (congregation) by great carved screens (rood screens). Many old churches still have them. But in the reformation and later, the Catholic idea of remoteness was replaced with a more progressive idea of togetherness and many screens were torn down.
