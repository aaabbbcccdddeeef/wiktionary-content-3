# An [[initialism]]: an [[abbreviation]] which is read letter-by-letter, such as "U.N."
#*'''2002''', Gunnel Tottie, ''An Introduction To American English'',<sup>[http://books.google.com/books?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC]</sup> Blackwell Publishing, ISBN 0631197923, page 118,
#*: Some '''alphabetisms''' are written as if they weren't '''alphabetisms''' at all, like ''deejay'' for ''DJ'', ''disc jockey'', or ''emcee'' for ''MC'', master of ceremonies.
# The ability to read an alphabet, a rudimentary form of [[literacy]].
#*'''2001''', Ziony Zevit, ''The Religions of Ancient Israel: A Synthesis of Parallactic Approaches'',<sup>[http://books.google.com/books?id=db4hr55j0yYC]</sup> Continuum International Publishing Group, ISBN 0826463398, page 639,

# Excessive reliance upon the alphabet or alphabetic structures.

# [[Discrimination]] on the basis of the first letter of a name.
#*'''1978''' November 13, ''[[w:The Capital|The Capital]]'' (Annapolis, MD),
#*: The injustice of "'''alphabetism'''" is, of course, a thorn in the Zitser side, and he playfully promises to assign the problem to "alphabetically neutral" aides.
