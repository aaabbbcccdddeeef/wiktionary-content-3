{{en-noun}}

# A citizen or native of [[Afghanistan]]. From an Afghan point of view this name is wrongly being used for Afghans. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan millions of Afghans took refuge in neighboring Pakistan. The Pakistanis and the international aid agencies coined this word to speak of Pakistanis versus the Afghanis. 

# {{usually|lowercase}} A [[monetary]] [[currency]] used in Afghanistan, divided into 100 [[pul]].  See [[afghani]].

# The word is also used by Fariswans (Persian-speaking Afghans) to denote the language of [[Pashto]]
