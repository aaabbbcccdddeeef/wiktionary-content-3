===Usage notes===
*The term is occasionally used to refer to the country of [[Australia]] (for example, “''back in Aussie''”), but this usage is very rare amongst Australians, who are more likely to use the term “''[[Oz]]''”. The exception seems to be sporting chants, such as “Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!” and “Come on, Aussie, come on!”, which appear to apply this usage.
