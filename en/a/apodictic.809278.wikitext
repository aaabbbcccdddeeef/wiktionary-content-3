'''Apodictic''' (Gr. ''apodeiktikos'', "capable of demonstration"), a [[logic]]al term, applied to judgments which are necessarily true, as of mathematical conclusions. The term in [[Aristotelian]] logic is opposed to [[dialectic]], as [[scientific proof]] to probable [[reasoning]]. [[Kant]] contrasts apodictical with problematic and assertorical.
