'''Apodictic''' ({{lang-grc|αποδεικτικος}}, "capable of demonstration"), a [[logic]]al term, applied to judgments which are necessarily true, as of mathematical conclusions. The term in [[Aristotelian]] logic is opposed to [[dialectic]], as [[scientific proof]] to probable [[reasoning]]. [[Kant]] contrasts apodictical with [[problematic (philosophy)|problematic]] and [[assertorical]].

The term "apodictic" is also sometimes applied to a style of argumentation, in which a person presents their  reasoning as categorically true, even if it is not necessarily so.  An example usage might be: "Don't be so apodictic!  You haven't considered several facets of the question."
