=====Usage notes=====
* Use of ''as'' as a relative conjunction meaning "that" dates to late Middle English and was formerly common in standard English<!--see cites-->, but is now only standard in constructions like "the same issue as she had" or "the identical issue as the appellant raised before"; otherwise, it is informal,<ref>{{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref> found in the dialects of the Midland, Southern, Midwestern and Western US<!--TBD: other regions via DARE-->; and of Lancashire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, East Anglia<!--incl. examples from Norfolk-->, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Surrey, and Cornwall; sometimes in Durham, Westmorland, Yorkshire and Somerset; only rarely in Northumberland and Scotland; and only in certain set phrases in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Devon.<ref>{{R:Wright}}</ref><!--TBD: Austalian, New Zealand, Canada, India, Ireland.-->

=====Usage notes=====
The object in older English may appear, and it may be prescribed as appearing, in the nominative case, similar to {{m-lite|en|than}}:

In modern everyday English, this may seem pedantic. However it is still mandatory if the verb is repeated:
: {{ux-lite|en|You are not as tall as '''I am'''.}}

==Latgalian==

===Pronunciation===
* {{ltg-IPA}}
* {{hyph-lite|ltg|as}}

===Pronoun===
{{head-lite|ltg|pronouns|langname=Latgalian}}

# {{archaic form of|ltg|es}}

===References===
* {{R:ltg:Nau:2011|page=35}}

----

==Latin==

===Alternative forms===
* {{alt|la|assis}}
* {{l|la|𐆚}} {{qualifier|symbol}}

===Etymology===
Probably borrowed from {{bor-lite|la|ett|-}}: compare {{m|la|lībra}} and {{m-lite|la|nummus}}, also loanwords. Original meaning was 'a rectangular bronze plaque weighing a pound'.

===Pronunciation===
* {{la-IPA|as}}
* {{la-IPA|as.s|eccl=no}} ''(before a vowel)''
* Note: the word is singularly and unreliably attested in poetry,<ref>Anthologia Latina 741, 1 (1066, 1)</ref> but together with its derivatives usually measures long. It's more likely that it retained the geminate consonant before a vowel than that the vowel itself was lengthened. Most recent dictionaries give it as short, but EDL and certain other etymologists<ref>{{cite-journal|en|author=Brent Vine|title=&quot;Latin bēs/bessis &#39;two thirds of an as&#39;&quot;|work=Tavet Tat Satyam: Studies in Honor of Jared S. Klein on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday|year=2016|page=327|url=https://www.academia.edu/39081498/_Latin_b%C4%93s_bessis_two_thirds_of_an_as_}}</ref> as long; compare {{m-lite|la|far}}.

===Noun===
{{la-noun|as/ass<3.I>|gen_pl=assium/assum|g=m}}

# an [[as]]; a Roman coin originally made of bronze and weighing one [[pound]], but later made of copper and reduced to two [[ounce]]s, one ounce, and eventually half an ounce.
## a [[penny]], a [[copper]] {{gl|a coin of low value}}
# pound as a unit of weight
# any [[undivided]] [[unit]] of [[measurement]]
## {{lb|la|with|{{m-lite|la|ex}}}} a whole [[estate]]
# a circular [[flap]] or [[valve]]
# any circular object; a [[slice]], [[disk]] {{gl|also of the [[moon]]}}

====Usage notes====
It is especially significant as being the coin of least value in the Classical age; as such it was often used in poetry as representative of the idea of worthlessness - one example being in ''Vivamus atque amemus'', where Catullus mentions "valuing opinions of old men at a single as". Two and a half asses equalled a single [[sesterce]].

====Declension====
* The genitive plural is normally ''assium'', but ''assum'' is found in {{w|Varro}}.
{{la-ndecl|as/ass<3.I>|gen_pl=assium/assum}}

====Derived terms====
* {{l|la|sēmis}}
* {{l-lite|la|bes}}, {{l-lite|la|des}}
* {{l-lite|la|tressis}}
* {{l|la|nōnussis}}

Note that in {{cog-lite|ota|-}} until its end – though it be that playing cards had been introduced in Turkey by Europeans and French in particular – the card was called {{m|ota|بك|tr=bey}}.
