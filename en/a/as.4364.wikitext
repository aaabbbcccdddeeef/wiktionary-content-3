=====Usage notes=====
* Use of ''as'' as a relative conjunction meaning "that" dates to late Middle English and was formerly common in standard English<!--see cites-->, but is now only standard in constructions like "the same issue as she had" or "the identical issue as the appellant raised before"; otherwise, it is informal,<ref>{{R:Dictionary.com}}</ref> found in the dialects of the Midland, Southern, Midwestern and Western US<!--TBD: other regions via DARE-->; and of Lancashire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, East Anglia<!--incl. examples from Norfolk-->, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Surrey, and Cornwall; sometimes in Durham, Westmorland, Yorkshire and Somerset; only rarely in Northumberland and Scotland; and only in certain set phrases in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Devon.<ref>{{R:Wright}}</ref><!--TBD: Austalian, New Zealand, Canada, India, Ireland.-->

===Etymology===
From {{inh|la|itc-ola|*ass}}, probably from {{der|la|ett|-}}. {{m|la|libra|Libra}} and {{m|la|nummus}} were also loanwords.

===Pronunciation===
* {{la-IPA|as}}

===Noun===
{{la-noun|as/ass<3.I>|gen_pl=assium/assum|g=m}}

# An {{l|en|as}}; a Roman coin originally made of bronze and weighing a pound, but later made of copper and weighing half an ounce.

====Usage notes====
It is especially significant as being the coin of least value in the Classical age; as such it was often used in poetry as representative of the idea of worthlessness - one example being in ''Vivamus atque amemus'', where Catullus mentions "valuing opinions of old men at a single as". 2 and a half asses equalled a single [[sesterce]].

====Declension====
* The genitive plural is normally ''assium'', but ''assum'' is found in {{w|Varro}}.

====Noun====
{{tr-noun|ı|lar}}

# [[ermine]]

Borrowed from {{bor|tr|fr|as}}.
