'''Air travel''' is a form of [[traveling]] using an [[airplane]].

The comfort on traveling by air depends on several factors starting with the airport, the choice of [[airline]] and the [[travel class]].

Travel class on an airplane is usually split into a two or four class model. National flights usually have two classes: [[Economy Class]] cabin and [[Business Class]] cabin, whereas international or transatlantic flights usually have four classes: an [[Economy Class]] cabin, a [[Premium Economy]] cabin, a [[Business Class]] or a [[Club Class]] cabin and finally, a [[First Class]] cabin. With the differences between [[Premium Economy]] and [[Economy]] being moderately significant, the [[cost]] is not greatly altered upon purchase of a [[Premium Economy]] ticket. The price of an [[Economy Class]] ticket and a [[First Class]] ticket are often extremely different, with prices for a [[First Class]] ticket being at least $1700 (£1000) more expensive. The difference between [[Standard Class]] and [[First Class]] when travelling by rail is often not as expensive, but tickets $1200 (£700) more expensive are not uncommon.

Any air travel starts and ends at an [[airport]]. The typical procedure is [[Airport Check-in|check-in]], [[border control]], [[Airport security]] check of baggage and passengers before entering the gate, [[boarding]], [[Flight|flying]] and pick-up of luggage and - limited to international flights - another border control at the host country [[border]].
