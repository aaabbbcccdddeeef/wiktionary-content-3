'''Air Travel''' is a form of [[travelling]] using an [[aeroplane]].

The comfort on travelling by air depends on several factors starting with the airport, the choice of [[airline]] and the [[travel class]].

Any Air Travel starts and ends at an airport. The typical procedure is [[check-in]], [[border control]], [[Airport security]] check of baggage and passengers before entering the gate, [[boarding, [[Flight|flying]] and pick-up of luggage and - on international flights - another border control at the host country.
