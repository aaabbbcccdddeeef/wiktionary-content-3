'''Air travel''' is a form of [[traveling]] using an [[airplane]].

The comfort on traveling by air depends on several factors starting with the airport, the choice of the [[airline]] and the [[travel class]].

Travel class on an airplane is usually split into a two or four class model. National flights usually have two classes: [[economy Class]] cabin and [[Business Class|business class]] [[aircraft cabin|cabin]], whereas long haul flights usually have four classes: an economy class cabin, a [[premium Economy|premium economy]] cabin, a business class or a [[club Class|club class]] cabin and finally, a [[First class travel|first class]] cabin. 

With the differences between premium economy and economy being moderately significant, the [[cost]] is not greatly altered upon purchase of a premium Economy ticket. The price of an economy class ticket and a first class ticket are often extremely different, with prices for a first class ticket being at least $1700 (£850) more expensive. The difference between [[standard Class]] and first Class when travelling by rail is often not as expensive, but tickets $1200 (£600) more expensive are not uncommon.

Any air travel starts and ends at a commercial [[airport]]. The typical procedure is [[Airport Check-in|check-in]], [[border control]], [[airport security]] check of baggage and passengers before entering the gate, [[boarding]], [[Flight|flying]] and pick-up of luggage and - limited to international flights - another border control at the host country [[border]].
