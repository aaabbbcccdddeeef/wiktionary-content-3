The term '''Ad Truck''', refers to driving or mobile billboards. The sole purpose of these trucks is to display advertising while driving. This truck differs from other trucks which may also contain advertising. For example, delivery trucks often exhibit advertisements on the side or back of the truck. By our definition, these trucks are not considered ad trucks unless they are not in the process of delivery, are not in the process of going to pick up products, and are driving around in order to display the advertisement. Another example, service trucks frequently promote publicity. These trucks are not considered advertising trucks either; unless they are driving only to attract attention to an advertisement.
