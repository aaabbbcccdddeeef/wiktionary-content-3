===Etymology===
Blended jocular mock-Latin word. Arose in America in the 19th century (about 1837). Probably made up of the following parts: The Latin adverb and prefix ''[[ab]]'', "away (from)", (maybe taken from [[abscond]]), the suffix ''[[-ate]]'' (maybe taken from [[perambulate]] or [[undulate]]), and the middle portion, "''squatul''", which might be a derivation of to ''[[squat]]''.
