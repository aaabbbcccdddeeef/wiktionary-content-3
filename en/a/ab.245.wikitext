'''ăb, ā, abs,''' ''preposition'' with the ''ablative case''. This Indo-European particle (Sanscrit apa or ava; Etruscan av; Greek '&alpha;&pi;&oacute;; Gothic af; Old German aba; New German ab; English of, off) has in Latin the following forms: ''ap, af, ab'' (av), ''au-, &acirc;, ă; aps, abs, as-.'' The existence of the oldest form, ''ap,'' is proved by the oldest and best manuscripts analogous to the preposition apud, the Sanscrit api, and the Greek '&epsilon;&pi;&iacute;, and by the weakened form, ''af'', which, by the rule of historical grammar and the nature of the Latin letter ''f'', can be derived only from ''ap'', not from ''ab''. The form ''af,'' weakened from ''ap,'' also very soon became obsolete. There are but five examples of it in inscriptions, at the end of the sixth and in the course of the seventh century B.C., namely: <small>AF VOBEIS,</small> Inscriptiones Orelli, 3114; <small>AF MVRO</small>, ibidem 6601; <small>AF CAPVA</small>, ibidem 3308; <small>AF SOLO</small>, ibidem 589; <small>AF LYCO</small>, ibidem 3036 (''afvolunt''=avolant, Paul ex Sextus Pompeius Festus page 26. Karl Ottfried M&uuml;ller [editor of Festus] is only a conjecture). In the time of Cicero this form was regarded as archaic, and only here and there used in account-books; see Cicero's Orator ad M. Brutum 47, 158 (where the correct reading is ''af'', not ''abs'' or ''ab''), and compare Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl's, ''Priscae Latinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica'' page 7 and following.&mdash;The second form of this preposition, changed from ''ap'', was ''ab'', which has become the principal form and the one most generally used through all periods&mdash;and indeed the only one used before all vowels and ''h;'' here and there also before some consonants, particularly ''l, n, r,'' and ''s;'' rarely before ''c, j, d, t;'' and almost never before the labials ''p, b, f, v'', or before ''m,'' such examples as ''ab'' Massiliensibus, Caesar's Bellum Civile 1, 35, being of the most rare occurrence.&mdash;By changing the ''b'' of ''ab'' through ''v'' into ''u,'' the form ''au'' originated, which was in use only in the two compounds ''aufero'' and ''aufugio'' for ab-fero, ab-fugio; ''aufuisse'' for afuisse, in the Codex laurentianus mediceus of Tacitus A. 12. 17, is altogether unusual. Finally, by dropping the ''b'' of ''ab'' and lengthening the ''a'', ''ab'' was changed into ''&acirc;'', which form, together with ''ab'', predominated through all periods of the Latin language, and took its place before all consonants in the later years of Cicero, and after him almost exclusively.&mdash;By dropping the ''b'' without lengthening the ''a'', ''ab'' occurs in the form ''ă-'' in the two compounds ''ă-b&icirc;to'' and ''ă-pĕrio'', quod videas.&mdash;On the other hand, instead of reducing ''ap'' to ''a'' and ''ă'', a strengthened collateral form, ''aps'', was made by adding to ''ap'' the letter ''s'' (also used in particles, as in ''ex, mox, vix''). From the first, ''aps'' was used only before the letters ''c, q, t,'' and was very soon changed into ''abs'' (as ''ap'' into ''ab''): abs chorago, Plautus' Persa 1, 3, 79 (159 Ritschl): abs quivis, Tertullianus' Ad Uxorem 2, 3, 1: abs terra, Cato, De Rustica 51; and in compounds: aps-cessero, Plautus' Trinummus 3, 1, 24 (625 Ritschl); idem ibidem 3, 2, 84 (710 Ritschl): abs-condo, abs-que, abs-tineo, etc. The use of ''abs'' was confined almost exclusively to the combination ''abs te'' during the whole ante-classic period, and with Cicero till about the year 700 A [b].U[rbe].C[ondita]. (=B.C. 54). After that time Cicero evidently hesitates between ''abs te'' and ''a te'', but during the last five or six years of his life ''a te'' became predominant in all his writings, even in his letters; consequently ''abs te'' apeas but rarely in later authors, as in Titus Livius 10, 19, 8; 26, 15, 12; and who, perhaps, also used abs conscendentibus, idem 28, 37, 2; vide Arnold Drakenborch [editor of Livy] ad hunc locum (W. Weissenborn [editor of Livy] ''ab'').&mdash;Finally ''abs'', in consequence of the following ''p,'' lost its ''b,'' and became ''&acirc;s-'' in the three compounds ''as-pello, as-porto,'' and ''as-pernor'' (for as-spernor); vide these words.&mdash;The late Latin verb ''abbrevio'' may stand for adbrevio, the ''d'' of ''ad'' being assimilated to the following ''b.''
The fundamental signification of ''ab'' is ''departure from some fixed point'' (opposed to ''ad'', which denotes motion to a point). '''I.''' In space, and, '''II.''' Figuratively, in time and other relations, in which the idea of departure from some point, as from source and origin, is included; English ''from, away from, out of; down from; since, after; by, at, in, on,'' etc.

'''I.''' Literally, in space: ab classe ad urbem tendunt, Lucius Accius (or Attius) in Nonius Marcellus 495, 22 (Trag. Rel. p. 177 Otto Ribbeck):{{ref|1}} Caesar maturat ab urbe proficisci, Caesar Bellum Gallicum 1, 7: fuga ab urbe turpissima, Cicero Epistolae ad Atticum 7, 21: ducite ab urbe domum, ducite Daphnim, Vergil Eclogae 8, 68. Cicero himself gives the difference between ''ab'' and ''ex'' thus: si qui mihi praesto fuerit cum armatis hominibus extra meum fundum et me introire prohibuerit, non ''ex'' eo, sed ''ab'' (''from, away from'') eo loco me dejecerit. ... Unde dejecti Galli? A Capitolio. Unde, qui cum Graccho fuerunt? ''Ex'' Capitolio, etc., Cicero Oratio pro Caecin&acirc; 30, 87; compare Diomedes p. 408 P., and a similar distinction between ''ad'' and ''in'' under [[ad]]. Elliptically: Diogenes Alexandro roganti, ut diceret, si quid opus esset: ''Nunc quidem paululum'', inquit, ''a sole, a little out of the sun'', Cicero Tusculanae Disputationes 5, 32, 92.&mdash;Often joined with usque: illam (mulierem) usque a mari supero Romam proficisci, ''all the way from'', Cicero Oratio pro Cluentio 68, 192; vide [[usque]], I.&mdash;And with ad, to denote the space passed over: siderum genus ab ortu ad occasum commeant, ''from...to'', Cicero De Deorum Natur&acirc; 2, 19 ''init.;'' compare ''ab...in;'' venti a laevo latere in dextrum, ut sol, ambiunt, Plinius 2, 47, 48, &#167; 128.

'''b.''' Sometimes with names of cities and small islands, or with domus (instead of the usual ''ablative'') particularly, in military and nautical language, to denote the marching of soldiers, the setting out of a fleet, or the departure of the inhabitants from some place: oppidum ab Aenea fugiente a Troj&acirc; conditum, Cicero's Actio in Verrem 2, 4, 33: quemadmodum (Caesar) a Gergovia discederet, Caesar's Bellum Gallicum 7, 43 ''at the end;'' so idem ibidem 7, 80 ''at the end;'' Sallustius Crispus' Jugurtha 61; 82; 91; Livius 2, 33, 6 and others; compare: ab Arimino M. Antonium cum cohortibus quinque Arretium mittit, Caesar's Bellum Civile 1, 11 ''at the end;'' and: protinus a Corfinio in Siciliam miserat, idem ibidem 1, 25, 2: profecti a domo, Livius 40, 33, 2; of setting sail: cum exercitus vestri numquam a Brundisio nisi hieme summ&acirc; transmiserint, Cicero's Oratio de Imperio Cn. Pompei [or Pro Lege Manili&acirc;] 12, 32; so idem Epistulae Familiares 15, 3, 2; Caesar Bellum Civile 3, 23; 3, 24 ''at the end:'' classe qu&acirc; advecti ab domo fuerant, Livius 8, 22, 6; of citizens: interim ab Roma legatos venisse nuntiatum est, Livius 21, 9, 3; compare: legati ab Orico ad M. Valerium praetorem venerunt, idem 24, 40, 2.
