'''ăb, ā, abs,''' ''preposition'' with the ''ablative case''. This Indo-European particle (Sanscrit apa or ava; Etruscan av; Greek '&alpha;&pi;&oacute;; Gothic af; Old German aba; New German ab; English of, off) has in Latin the following forms: ''ap, af, ab'' (av), ''au-, &acirc;, ă; aps, abs, as-.'' The existence of the oldest form, ''ap,'' is proved by the oldest and best manuscripts analogous to the preposition apud, the Sanscrit api, and the Greek '&epsilon;&pi;&iacute;, and by the weakened form, ''af'', which, by the rule of historical grammar and the nature of the Latin letter ''f'', can be derived only from ''ap'', not from ''ab''. The form ''af,'' weakened from ''ap,'' also very soon became obsolete. There are but five examples of it in inscriptions, at the end of the sixth and in the course of the seventh century B.C., namely: <small>AF VOBEIS,</small> Inscriptiones Orelli, 3114; <small>AF MVRO</small>, ibidem 6601; <small>AF CAPVA</small>, ibidem 3308; <small>AF SOLO</small>, ibidem 589; <small>AF LYCO</small>, ibidem 3036 (''afvolunt''=avolant, Paul ex Sextus Pompeius Festus page 26. Karl Ottfried M&uuml;ller [editor of Festus] is only a conjecture). In the time of Cicero this form was regarded as archaic, and only here and there used in account-books; see Cicero's Orator ad M. Brutum 47, 158 (where the correct reading is ''af'', not ''abs'' or ''ab''), and compare Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl's, ''Priscae Latinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica'' page 7 and following.&mdash;The second form of this preposition, changed from ''ap'', was ''ab'', which has become the principal form and the one most generally used through all periods&mdash;and indeed the only one used before all vowels and ''h;'' here and there also before some consonants, particularly ''l, n, r,'' and ''s;'' rarely before ''c, j, d, t;'' and almost never before the labials ''p, b, f, v'', or before ''m,'' such examples as ''ab'' Massiliensibus, Caesar's Bellum Civile 1, 35, being of the most rare occurrence.&mdash;By changing the ''b'' of ''ab'' through ''v'' into ''u,'' the form ''au'' originated, which was in use only in the two compounds ''aufero'' and ''aufugio'' for ab-fero, ab-fugio; ''aufuisse'' for afuisse, in the Codex laurentianus mediceus of Tacitus A. 12. 17, is altogether unusual.
