====Synonyms====
*[[subside]]; [[decrease]]; [[intermit]]; [[decline]]; [[diminish]]; [[lessen]].
*These words, as here compared, imply a coming down from some previously raised or excited state. 
*''Abate'' expresses this in respect to degrees, and implies a [[diminution]] of force or of [[intensity]]; as, the storm abates, the cold abates, the force of the wind abates; or, the wind abates, a fever abates. 
*''Subside'' (to settle down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or [[commotion]]; as, the waves subside after a storm, the wind subsides into a calm. 
*When the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be observed. If we conceive of a thing as having different degrees of intensity or strength, the word to be used is ''abate''. Thus we say, a man's anger abates, the ardor of one's love abates, Winter's rage abates. But if the image be that of a sinking down into quiet from preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is ''subside''; as, the tumult of the people subsides, the public mind subsided into a calm. 
The same is the case with those emotions which are tumultuous in their nature; as, his passion subsides, his joy quickly subsided, his grief subsided into a pleasing melancholy. Yet if, in such cases, we were thinking of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might use ''abate''; as, his joy will abate in the progress of time; and so in other instances.
