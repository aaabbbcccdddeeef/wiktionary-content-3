#* '''1847''', Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'':
#*: In the servants’ hall two coachmen and three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the '''abigails''', I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.
