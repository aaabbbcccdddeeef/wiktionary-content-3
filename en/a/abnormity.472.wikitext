#* '''1893''', Adeline Dutton Train Whitney, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13997 Real Folks]'':
#*: Why do critics—some of them—make such short, smart work,—such cheerful, confident despatch, nowadays, of a story with religion in it, as if it were an '''abnormity''',—a thing with sentence of death in itself, like a calf born with two heads,—that needs not their trouble, save to name it as it is?
# A [[monstrosity]] {{defdate|First attested in the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century.}}<ref name=SOED/>
