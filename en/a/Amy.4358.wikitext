====Quotations====
* '''1886''' Hubert Hall: ''Society in the Elizabethan Age''. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. ISBN 0766139743  page 94:
*: The Dame Anne Dudley, mentioned in a contemporary record, was Leicester's first wife, the unfortunate '''Amy''' Robsart. It may be noticed, in passing, that the name '''Amy''' - presuming that it occurs in contemporary manuscripts of authority - is an extremely rare one. It is obvious how easily the name ''Aime'' might be read for Anne.
* '''1975''' Derek Marlowe: ''Nightshade''. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1975. page 7:
*: As a child, '''Amy''' could have been drawn by Millais, if he was inclined - the name '''Amy''' is deceptively apt - but though the plumpness remains, not much but some, the ringlets have gone to be replaced by curls of the colour of cinnamon.
* '''1999''' Susan Butler, Lawrence Butler: ''East to the Dawn: The Life of Amelia Earhart.'' ISBN 0306808870  page 5:
*: As '''Amy''' had been baptized Amelia ( but always called '''Amy''') after her mother, now her daughter, too, was baptized Amelia.
