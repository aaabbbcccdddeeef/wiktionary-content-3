==English==
===Etymology===
From French meaning '''[[beloved]]''' and '''[[friend]]'''.
<br>{{etystub}} Which is true?  "Aim√©e" (which also exists as the name) would be "loved" (of a woman), and "amie" is friend, but I wouldn't think it comes from both - probably just from the first. &mdash; [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 17:15, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

===Proper noun===
'''Amy''' (''plural'' '''Amys''')

#A female [[given name]].
