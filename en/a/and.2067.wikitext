====Usage notes====
<ol><li>Beginning a sentence with ''and'' or any other conjunction is considered incorrect by classical grammarians, but use of the word in this way is very common. the practice will be found in literature from Anglo-Saxon times onwards, especially as an aid to continuity in narrative and dialogue. The ''OED'' provides examples from the 9th century to the 19th century, including one from Shakespeare's ''King John:'' "''Arthur''. Must you with hot Irons, burne out both mine eyes? ''Hubert.'' Young boy, I must. ''Arthur''. And will you? ''Hubert''. And I will." It is also used for other rhetorical purposes, especially to denote surprise

<blockquote>(O John! and you have seen him! And are you really going?—1884</blockquote>

in ''OED'') and sometimes just to introduce an improvised afterthought 

<blockquote>(I'm going to swim. And don't you dare watch—G. Butler, 1983)</blockquote>

It is however poor style to separate short statements into separate sentences when no special effect is needed: ''I opened the door and I looked into the room'' ('''not''' ''I opened the door. And I looked into the room).''

<li>''And'' is often omitted for contextual effects of various kinds, especially between sequences of descriptive adjectives which can be separated by commas or simply by spaces 

<blockquote>(The teeming jerrybuilt dun-coloured traffic-ridden deafening city—Penelope Lively, 1987)</blockquote>

''And all'' is a well-established tag added to the end of a statement, as in 

<blockquote>Isn't it amazing? He has a Ph.D. and all—J. Shute, 1992</blockquote>

. With the nominal meaning "also, besides, in addition," the use has origins in dialect, as can be seen from the material from many regions given in the ''English Dialect Dictionary'' (often written in special ways, e.g., ''ano', an'-all, an' a'''). In many of the examples it seems to lack any perceptible lexical meaning and to be just a rhythmical device to eke out a sentence.

<li>''And'' also has special uses: to show progression ''(faster and faster),'' cause and effect ''(do that and I'll send you to bed),'' duration ''(they ran and ran),'' a large number or quantity ''(miles and miles),'' and addition ''(four and four are eight),'' purpose (where ''and replaces to: Try and come tomorrow'').

<li>Another special use, recorded in the ''OED'' from the 16th century, is to express "a difference of quality between things of the same name or class," as in W. S. Gilbert's lines from the ''Gondoliers'' (1889): "Well, as to that, of course there are kings and kings. When I say I detest kings I mean I detest bad kings." To this we may add some modern examples:

<blockquote>There are ways to steal and there are ways to steal—''New Yorker,'' 1988</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is homelessness and homelessness. The word has become a shibboleth for opposition politicians and the ‘caring’ media . . . The sort of homelessness which means despair is quite different from the sort that means adventure—''Times,'' 1991</blockquote></ol>
