=====Usage notes=====
{{rel-top|Usage notes}}
<ol><li>Beginning a sentence with {{term|and|lang=en}} or other coordinating conjunctions is considered incorrect by classical grammarians arguing that a coordinating conjunction at the start of a sentence has nothing to connect, but use of the word in this way is very common. The practice will be found in literature from Anglo-Saxon times onwards, especially as an aid to continuity in narrative and dialogue. The ''OED'' provides examples from the 9<sup>th</sup> century to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, including one from Shakespeare’s ''King John:'' “''Arthur''. Must you with hot Irons, burne out both mine eyes? ''Hubert.'' Young boy, I must. ''Arthur''. And will you? ''Hubert''. And I will.” It is also used for other rhetorical purposes, especially to denote surprise

<blockquote>(O John! and you have seen him! And are you really going?—1884 in ''OED'') </blockquote>

and sometimes just to introduce an improvised afterthought

<blockquote>(I’m going to swim. And don’t you dare watch—G. Butler, 1983)</blockquote>

It is, however, poor style to separate short statements into separate sentences when no special effect is needed: ''I opened the door and I looked into the room'' (not *''I opened the door. And I looked into the room''). Combining sentences or starting with ''in addition'' or ''moreover'' is preferred in formal writing.

<li>{{term|and|And|lang=en}} is often omitted for contextual effects of various kinds, especially between sequences of descriptive adjectives which can be separated by commas or simply by spaces

<blockquote>(The teeming jerrybuilt dun-coloured traffic-ridden deafening city—Penelope Lively, 1987)</blockquote>

{{term|and all|And all|lang=en}} is a well-established tag added to the end of a statement, as in

<blockquote>Isn’t it amazing? He has a Ph.D. and all—J. Shute, 1992</blockquote>

With the nominal meaning “also, besides, in addition”, the use has origins in dialect, as can be seen from the material from many regions given in the ''English Dialect Dictionary'' (often written in special ways, e.g., {{term||ano'|lang=en}}, {{term||an'-all|lang=en}}, {{term||an' a'|lang=en}}). In many of the examples it seems to lack any perceptible lexical meaning and to be just a rhythmical device to eke out a sentence.
