==English==

===Etymology===
Back-formation from [[aborigines]]

===Proper noun===
'''Aborigine'''

# [an] [[Aboriginal]] inhabitant of a country.
# [an] [[Aboriginal]] Australian.

====Translations====
{{trans-top|aboriginal inhabitant of a country}}
*Czech: [[domorodec]] {{m}}
{{trans-mid}}
{{trans-bottom}}

===Usage notes===
*Should be capitalized in Australian contexts.
*Fowler's 3rd edition considers this singular to be "etymologically indefensible" notwithstanding its having become the established form in Australia since 1829.  This is in reference to its inflection from 'Aborigines', not actually originally an S-addition pluralization (see Aborigine/Aborigines/Aboriginal entries in Oxford Dictionary).
