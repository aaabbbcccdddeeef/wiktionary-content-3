Three days earlier the French, British and Americans had prepared an ''armistice'' document which they demanded the Germans accept within three days. Inside the carriage the Germans signed the surrender document put before them. The document signalled that the war would stop in six hours' time, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918.}}
