===Etymology===
From {{der|en|la|abhominalis}}, from {{m|la|ab||away from}} + {{m|la|homo|hominis|man}}, but in practice from {{m+|en|abominable}}, which was erroneously folk-etymologized as this word, leading to this spelling and {{m|en|abhominable}}, which see for more.<ref>See quotations below, and e.g. James Mitchell, ''Significant Etymology: Or, Roots, Stems, and Branches of the English Language'' (1908), page 17: "The customary spelling of [abominable] in old writers is ''abhominable'', on the supposition that the true etymology was ''ab'' + ''homine''—''i.e.'', "apart from man," "repugnant to humanity," and meant "unbecoming a man," "inhuman." This was favoured by Augustine in one of his sermons. Hence also the independent formation abhominal used by Fuller and others, and  in old English books it is often used in a sense corresponding to its supposed  origin, nor has it as yet fully recovered its proper meaning."</ref>

#*: *This is one of Fuller's humorous exemplifications of verbal criticisms, deriving our common word "abominable" from ''ab'' and ''homo'', ''homonis'', and thus converting it into the very expressive term ''abhominal'', "unworthy of a man," "unmanly,", "inhuman."—E<small>DIT</small>.
