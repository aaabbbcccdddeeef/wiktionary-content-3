=====Usage note=====
*Abandon, [[desert]], [[forsake]]. These words agree in representing a person as ''giving up'' or ''leaving'' some object, but [[differ]] as to the mode of doing it. The [[distinctive]] sense of abandon is that of giving up a thing absolutely and [[finally]]; as, to abandon one’s friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a [[hopeless]] enterprise, a [[shipwrecked]] vessel.
*''Abandon'' is more widely [[applicable]] than ''forsake'' or ''desert''. The Latin original of ''desert'' appears to have been originally applied to the case of [[deserter]]s from military service. Hence, the verb, when used of ''persons'' in the active voice, has usually or always a bad sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of something which the person should rightfully stand by and support; as, to ''desert'' one’s colors, to ''desert'' one's post, to ''desert'' one’s principles or duty. When used in the passive, the sense is not necessarily bad; as, the fields were ''deserted'', a ''deserted'' village, ''deserted'' halls.
*''Forsake'' implies the breaking off of previous habit, association, personal connection, or that the thing left had been familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to ''forsake'' the paths of [[rectitude]], the blood ''forsook'' his cheeks. It may be used either in a good or in a bad sense.
