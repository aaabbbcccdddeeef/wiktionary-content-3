===Adverb===
'''[[at]] [[one]][['s|’s]] [[wits]]’ [[end]]'''

# {{idiom}} Unable to find a way to do something or deal with something, despite much effort.
#:''After six hours of trial and error, I am really '''at my wits’ end''' over this problem.''

====Usage notes====
* Note that the apostrophe is after the {{s}} of ''wits'', as the phrase means "at the end of one's wits" (one's abilities) not "at the end of one's wit" (one's humour, one's intelligence).
