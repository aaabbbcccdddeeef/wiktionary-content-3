# A form of [[lava]] flow of [[basaltic]] [[rock]], usually dark-colored with a [[jagged]] and loose, [[clinkery]] surface. It is one of two chief forms of lava flow emitted from [[volcano]]es of the Hawaiian type, the other form being [[pahoehoe]].
#: '''Quotations
#:* '''1859''' - R. C. Haskell in ''American journal of science and arts'', series XXVIII
#:*: We...saw ‘pahoihoi’ or solid lava forming, and also ‘'''aa'''’ or clinkers.
#:* '''1883''' - Clarence E. Dutton in the fourth ''Annual report'' of the United States Geological Survey
#:*: The second form of the lavas is called by the natives '''a-a''', and its contrast with pahoehoe is about the greatest imaginable. It consists mainly of clinkers sometimes detached, sometimes partially agglutinated together with a bristling array of sharp, jagged, angular fragments.
#:* '''1944''' - Charles A. Cotton: ''Volcanoes as landscape forms''
#:*: Cooling and solidification frequently takes a different course...in lava flows, producing the clinker-like ‘'''aa'''’ lava.
