The [[Army]] National Guard (ARNG) is one component of the total U.S. Army, which consists of Active, Guard, and Reserve components. The Army National Guard is composed of citizen-soldiers â€“ civilians who serve their country on a part-time basis. Each state and territory has its own Army National Guard as established in the United States Constitution. The Army National Guard provides more than half the combat power of America's Army, as well as more than a third of its combat support and combat service support structure.
