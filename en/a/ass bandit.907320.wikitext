===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[ass]] [[bandit]]}}

Referred to in a fourth-season episode of Nip/Tuck as a person posing as a doctor who anally molests medical patients.

===Usage notes===
This is not a mis-translation from British English's [[arse bandit]], rather was a rude reference to getting a [[piece of ass]] (a phrase which mostly ''has'' survived in Modern American English.)
