===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[ass]] [[bandit]]}}

# {{obsolete|US|mid 1900s}} A man who [[seduce]]s young [[women]].
No - its a gay reference, like "shirt lifter".

===Usage notes===
This is not a mis-translation from British English's [[arse bandit]], rather was a rude reference to getting a [[piece of ass]] (a phrase which mostly ''has'' survived in Modern American English.)
