===Noun===
{{en-noun|head=[[ass]] [[bandit]]}}

# {{context|obsolete|US|mid 1900s|lang=en}} A man who [[seduce]]s young [[women]].

===Usage notes===
This is not a mis-translation from British English's [[arse bandit]], but was rather a rude reference to getting a [[piece of ass]] (a phrase which mostly ''has'' survived in Modern American English.)
