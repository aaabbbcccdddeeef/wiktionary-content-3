==English==

===Etymology===
Alteration of {{m|en|albeit}}, replacing {{m|en|it}} with {{m|en|they}}. {{m|en||Albeit}} literally means “although it [may] be”, but has become univerbated as a conjunction in Standard English. Accordingly, a phrase like {{m|en||they were good parents, albeit indulgent}} should be read as “albeit [that they were] indulgent”. Speakers who are still aware of the underlying construct, however, may feel that {{m|en||they}} should be used for “proper” agreement, hence {{m|en||albethey indulgent}}. (Theoretically, this would require other forms like {{m|en||*albehe}}, {{m|en||*albeshe}}, etc., depending on the context.)
