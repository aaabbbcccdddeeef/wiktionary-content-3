==English==

===Etymology===
Likely from false assumptions about {{m|en|albeit}}, replacing {{m|en|it}} with {{m|en|they}}. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' explains ''albeit'' as being from “all be it (that)” or in full “all though it be that”. Originally, therefore, the impersonal “it” should have remained unchanged even when “albeit” followed a plural noun (and still today ''albeit'' is widely accepted due to lack of concise alternative).
