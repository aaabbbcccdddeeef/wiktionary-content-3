The rise in water level (above normal) on the upstream side of a bridge or obstruction caused when the effective flow area at the obstruction is less than the natural width of the stream immediately upstream of the obstruction. In case of a bridge such an afflux can be caused by the obstruction produced by piers and projecting abutments.
