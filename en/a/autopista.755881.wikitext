====Usage notes====
In Spain, the {{m|es|autovía|autovías}} never have a toll, and the {{m|es|autopista|autopistas}} usually have a toll. The ''autovías'' are of poorer quality than the ''autopistas''. The ''autovías'' have sharper/tighter curves and steeper slopes. Access and exit lanes are often shorter and do not meet the minimum length required on ''autopistas''. It is even possible to find bus stops on the ''autovía'' itself.
