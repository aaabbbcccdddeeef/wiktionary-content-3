**We are ''abashed'' when struck either with sudden shame or with a [[humbling]] sense of inferiority; as, [[Peter]] was ''abashed'' by the look of his Master. So a [[modest]] youth is ''abashed'' in the presence of those who are greatly his superiors. 
**We are ''confused'' when, from some [[unexpected]] or [[startling]] [[occurrence]], we lose [[clearness]] of thought and self-possession.

**We are ''confounded'' when our minds are [[overwhelmed]], as it were, by something wholly unexpected, [[amazing]], dreadful, etc., so that we have nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually ''confounded'' at the [[discovery]] of his guilt.
