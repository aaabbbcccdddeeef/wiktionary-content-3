====Usage notes====
* Of abash, [[confuse]], [[confound]]: '''Abash''' is a [[stronger]] word than '''confuse''', but not so strong as '''confound'''.
** We are ''abashed'' when struck either with sudden shame or with a [[humbling]] sense of inferiority; as, [[Peter]] was ''abashed'' by the look of his Master. So a [[modest]] youth is ''abashed'' in the presence of those who are greatly his superiors.
** We are ''confused'' when, from some [[unexpected]] or [[startling]] [[occurrence]], we lose [[clearness]] of thought and self-possession. Thus, a witness is often ''confused'' by a severe [[cross-]]examination; a [[timid]] person is apt to be ''confused'' in [[entering]] a room full of [[strangers]].
** We are ''confounded'' when our minds are [[overwhelmed]], as it were, by something wholly unexpected, [[amazing]], dreadful, etc., so that we have nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually ''confounded'' at the [[discovery]] of his guilt.
*::* Satan stood Awhile as mute, confounded what to say. - John Milton
