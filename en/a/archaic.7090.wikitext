Comes from Greek ''arkhaikos'' meaning "old-fashioned."

===Adjective===
'''archaic''' (more archaic, most archaic)

#of or characterized by [[antiquity]] or [[archaism]], [[antiquated]], [[primitive]], [[old-fashioned]], as an archaic word or phrase
#*'''1848:''' [[w:James Russel Lowell|James Russel Lowell]], ''The Biglow Papers'' - A person familiar with the dialect of certain portions of Massachusetts will not fail to recognize, in ordinary discourse, many words now noted in English vocabularies as '''archaic''', the greater part of which were in common use about the time of the King James translation of the Bible.  Shakespeare stands less in need of a glossary to most New Englanders than to many a native of the Old Country.
#*'''1887:''' [[w:Barcley V. Head|Barcley V. Head]], ''Historia Numorum A Manual Of Greek Numismatics'' - There is in the best '''archaic''' coin work [of the Greeks] ... a strength and a delicacy which are often wanting in the fully developed art of a later age.
