====Usage notes====
Sometimes used interchangeably with other terms such as {{m|en|street}}. When distinguished, an '''avenue''' is generally broad and tree-lined. Further, in many American cities laid out on a grid, notably [[Manhattan]], streets run east-west, while '''avenues''' run north-south.

When abbreviated in an address (such as "Malcolm Ave" or "Fisher Av.") a capital "A" is normally used and a [[full stop]] (period) only used if "e" is not the last letter of the abbreviation.

In French traditionally used for routes between two places within a city, named for the destination (or formally where it is coming ''from''), as in the archetypal ''Avenue des {{w|Champs-Élysées}}.'' This distinction is not observed in US English, where names such as “{{w|Fifth Avenue}}” are common. In British English, 'Avenue' is usually more associated with a tree-lined street and is sometimes named after the species of tree e.g. {{w|Acacia Avenue}}.
