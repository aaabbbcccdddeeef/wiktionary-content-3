These words have in common the idea of setting aside by some [[overruling]] act.
* ''Abolish'' [[applies]] particularly to things of a permanent nature, such as institutions, usages, customs, etc.; as, to ''abolish'' [[monopolies]], [[serfdom]], slavery. ''Repeal'' [[describes]] the act by which the legislature of a state sets aside a law which it had previously [[enacted]].
* ''Abrogate'' was originally applied to the [[repeal]] of a law by the Roman people; and hence, when the power of making laws was [[usurped]] by the [[emperors]], the term was applied to ''their'' act of setting aside the laws. Thus it came to express that act by which a sovereign or an [[executive]] government sets aside laws, [[ordinances]], [[regulations]], [[treaties]], [[conventions]], etc.
* ''Revoke'' denotes the act of [[recalling]] some previous grant which [[conferred]], privilege, etc.; as, to ''revoke'' a decree, to ''revoke'' a power of [[attorney]], a promise, etc. Thus, also, we speak of the ''revocation'' of the [[Edict]] of [[Nantes]].

* ''Nullify'' is an old word applied to the setting of things aside either by force or by total [[disregard]]; as, to ''nullify'' an act of Congress.
