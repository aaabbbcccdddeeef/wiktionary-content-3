{{wikipedia|Anti-Semitism}}
==English==

===Etymology===
:1879, German: ''Antisemitismus'', coined by German political agitator [[w:Wilhelm Marr|Wilhelm Marr]] to replace ''Judenhass'', making hatred of the Jews seem rational and sanctioned by scientific knowledge.  Similar term ''antisemitisch'' (anti-semitic) dates from 1860, by Jewish scholar [[w:Moritz Steinschneider|Moritz Steinschneider]].  See Wikipedia: [[w: Antisemitism#Etymology_and_usage|Antisemitism:Etymology and Usage]]

===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[anti]]-[[Semitism]]|-}}

# Prejudice, discrimination or hostility directed against [[Jew]]s or [[Judaism]].

====Usage notes====
:Though ''[[Semitic]]'' refers in a broader sense to those who speak Semitic languages (e.g. [[w:Arab|Arabs]] or [[w:Assyrian_people|Assyrians]]), the term ''anti-semitism'' has historically referred to prejudice against Jews alone.  To avoid the confusion of the [[misnomer]], many scholars on the subject (such as [[w:Emil Fackenheim|Emil Fackenheim]]) now favor the unhyphenated ''antisemitism'' in order to emphasize that the word should be read as a single unified term, not as a meaningful root word-prefix combination.<ref>[http://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf Antisemitism. The Power of Myth (Facing History), ''Defining Antisemitism'' p. 2 (PDF p.5)]</ref> <ref>“…the spelling ought to be antisemitism without the hyphen, dispelling the notion that there is an entity "Semitism" which "anti-Semitism" opposes.” -- Emil Fackenheim,''Post-Holocaust Anti-Jewishness, Jewish Identity and the Centrality of Israel'', in '''World Jewry and the State of Israel'''. ed.
