==English==

===Etymology===
:1879, German: ''Antisemitismus'', coined by German political agitator [[w:Wilhelm Marr|Wilhelm Marr]] to replace ''Judenhass'', making hatred of the Jews seem rational and sanctioned by scientific knowledge.  Similar term ''antisemitisch'' (anti-semitic) dates from 1860, by Jewish scholar [[w:Moritz Steinschneider|Moritz Steinschneider]].  See Wikipedia: [[w: Antisemitism#Etymology and usage|Antisemitism:Etymology and Usage]]

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|US}} {{IPA|/ˌæntɑɪˈsɛmɪtɪzm̩/}}, {{X-SAMPA|%{ntAI"sEmItIzm=}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[anti-]][[Semitism]]}}

# Prejudice, discrimination or hostility directed against [[Semites]], particularly [[Jew]]s.

====Usage notes====
:Though ''[[Semitic]]'' refers in a broader sense to people of the [[Middle East]] who speak Semitic languages (e.g. [[w:Arab|Arabs]] or [[w:Assyrian people|Assyrians]]), the term ''anti-semitism'' has historically referred to prejudice against Jews, the predominant Semitic subpopulation of Europe and America, though [[Gypsies]] too have been targets of anti-Semitism. Now, "[[Paki]]s" in Britain and [[Turks]] in Germany are victims of anti-Semitism. To avoid the confusion of the [[misnomer]], many scholars on the subject (such as [[w:Emil Fackenheim|Emil Fackenheim]]) now favor the unhyphenated ''antisemitism'' in order to emphasize that the word should be read as a single unified term, not as a meaningful root word-prefix combination.<ref>[http://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf Antisemitism. The Power of Myth (Facing History), ''Defining Antisemitism'' p. 2 (PDF p.5)]</ref><ref>“…the spelling ought to be antisemitism without the hyphen, dispelling the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes.” -- Emil Fackenheim, ''Post-Holocaust Anti-Jewishness, Jewish Identity and the Centrality of Israel'', in '''World Jewry and the State of Israel'''. ed. Moshe David, p11, n2.</ref><ref>“Antisemitism is not a scientific word, and it is entitled to neither a hyphen nor a capital.” Dr.  James Parkes, 1953, quoted in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/i/irving.david/jackel/postscript-kirk-6 Holocaust Almanac: David Irving's Hitler: Postscript]</ref> See Wikipedia: [[w: Antisemitism#Etymology and usage|Antisemitism:Etymology and Usage]]
=====Criticism=====
The principle current academic supporter of this position, [[w:Bernard Lewis|Bernard Lewis]], was found by a French court to have erred in denying the [[w:Armenian genocide|Armenian genocide]] for fear of it being used "to diminish the worth of the [[w:Jewish Holocaust|Jewish Holocaust]]." The court stated that ''"by concealing elements contrary to his opinion, he neglected his duties of objectivity and prudence''<ref>[http://www.voltairenet.org/article14133.html Lewis receives adverse civil judgment], 21 June 1995 {{Fr icon}}</ref>.
