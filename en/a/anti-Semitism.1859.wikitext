{{wikipedia|Anti-Semitism}}
==English==

===Etymology===
:1879, German: ''Antisemitismus'', coined by German political agitator [[w:Wilhelm Marr|Wilhelm Marr]] to replace ''Judenhass'', making hatred of the Jews seem rational and sanctioned by scientific knowledge.  Similar term ''antisemitisch'' (anti-semitic) dates from 1860, by Jewish scholar [[w:Moritz Steinschneider|Moritz Steinschneider]].  See Wikipedia: [[w: Antisemitism#Etymology_and_usage|Antisemitism:Etymology and Usage]]

===Noun===
{{en-noun|sg=[[anti]]-[[Semitism]]|-}}

# Prejudice, discrimination or hostility directed against [[Jew]]s or [[Judaism]].

====Usage notes====
:Though ''[[Semitic]]'' refers in a broader sense to those who speak Semitic languages (e.g. [[w:Arab|Arabs]] or [[w:Assyrian_people|Assyrians]]), the term ''anti-semitism'' has historically referred to prejudice against Jews alone.  To avoid the confusion of the [[misnomer]], many scholars on the subject (such as [[w:Emil Fackenheim|Emil Fackenheim]]) now favor the unhyphenated ''antisemitism'' in order to emphasize that the word should be read as a single unified term, not as a meaningful root word-prefix combination.
