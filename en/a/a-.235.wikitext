==English==

===Usage notes===
Different Germanic senses of ''a-'' became confused – vaguely “intensive” – and are no longer productive. The Greek sense of “not” (e.g., {{term|amoral}}) remains productive.
: “[I]t naturally happened that all these ''a-'' prefixes were at length confusedly lumped together in idea, and the resultant ''a-'' looked upon as vaguely intensive, rhetorical, [[euphonic]] [nice-sounding], or even archaic, and wholly [[otiose]] [pointless].” OED.

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|ang}} {{term|a-|ā-|lang=ang}}, originally *{{term||ar-, *or-|lang=ang}}, from {{proto|Germanic|uz-|out-|lang=en}}, from {{proto|Indo-European|uds-|up, out|lang=en}}. Cognate with German {{term|er-|lang=de}}.

=====Usage notes=====
Beyond its use it a few words such as {{term|aware|lang=en}} (which has replaced the plain {{term|ware|lang=en}}), common use of this prefix is fossilized in a few songs, as listed above, and its productive use is considered highly archaic or poetic. It remains in use in Appalachian English.
