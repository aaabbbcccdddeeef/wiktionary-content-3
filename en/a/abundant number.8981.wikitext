# {{lb|en|number theory}} A number that is less than the sum of its [[proper]] [[divisor]]s (all divisors except the number itself).
#: ''The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30, and 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 15 = 42, which is greater than 30, so 30 is an '''abundant number'''.''

#*: It has been shown that the largest odd number which cannot be written as the sum of two '''abundant numbers''' is 20161.

#*: (a) Let ''k'' be fixed. Do there exist sequences of ''k'' consecutive '''abundant numbers'''?
#* '''1996''', Richard R. Hall, ''Sets of Multiples'', {{w|Cambridge University Press}}, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=40g9YJIck0QC&pg=PR11&dq=%22abundant+number%22%7C%22abundant+numbers%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiahfDN2cvdAhVnyVQKHWBkBcAQ6AEISzAH#v=onepage&q=%22abundant%20number%22%7C%22abundant%20numbers%22&f=false page xi],
#*: We shall not be concerned with '''abundant numbers''' in this book, nevertheless it may be helpful to use this historical example as an illustration. We note the property that any multiple of an '''abundant number''' is abundant.

====Notes====
* The requirement may be expressed as <math>s(n)>n</math>, where <math>s(n)</math> denotes the {{m|en|aliquot sum}} (sum of proper divisors) of <math>n</math>.
** It is also sometimes expressed as <math>\sigma(n)>2n</math>, where <math>\sigma(n)</math> (sometimes <math>\sigma_1(n)</math>) denotes the sum of ''all'' divisors of <math>n</math>.
* Given an abundant number <math>n</math>, the amount, <math>s(n)-n,</math> by which the aliquot sum exceeds it may be called its {{m|en|abundance}}.
* For arbitrary <math>n</math>, the ratio <math>\frac{\sigma(n)}{n}</math> may be called its {{m|en|abundancy index}}. Thus, an abundant number is one whose abundancy index is > 2.
