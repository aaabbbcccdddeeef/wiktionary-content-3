===Etymology===
From {{etyl|NL.|en}} ''anergia'', from Greek ''[[an-#Etymology_3|an-]]'' ("not"; "without") + ''ergon'' ("work").

===Noun===
{{en-noun|~|anergies}}

# {{label|en|physics}} A [[w:Matter wave|matter wave]]'s absolute anergy (zero-frequency energy) is its gravitational [[potential energy]], equal to the negative of the matter wave's energy (''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[w:Planck constant|''h'']][[w:frequency|''f'']]); the absolute anergy is maximal (zero) when [[w:frequency|''f'']] is zero, and negative when [[w:frequency|''f'']] is nonzero.
# {{label|en|physics}} A relative anergy is a dilute or disorganized [[energy]], which cannot be transformed into work.
#* The maximum fraction of an energy form which (in a reversible process) can be transformed into work is called exergy. The remaining part is called '''anergy''', and this corresponds to the waste heat.<ref>Honerkamp, J. ♦ Statistical Physics ♦ Springer, 2002, p. 298</ref>
#* To be useful, internal energy has to be concentrated. The more dilute or disorganized the internal energy, the less useful it is ...<ref>Newman, Jay ♦ Physics of the Life Sciences ♦ Springer, 2008, p. 336</ref>
# {{label|en|pathology}} Deficiency of energy.
# {{label|en|immunology}} Lack of [[immunity]] to an [[antigen]].
