===Usage notes===
* "This word, as used in law, is spelt ''accessory'' by Blackstone and many others; but in this sense is spelt ''accessary'' by Bouvier, Burrill, Burns, Whishaw, Dane, and the Penny Cyclopedia; while in other senses it is spelt ''accessory''. In recent [[textbook|text-books]] on criminal law the distinction is not [[preserved]], the spelling being either ''accessary'' or ''accessory''." - ''Webster, 1913''. Since that time this trend has accelerated.
