===Etymology===
{{wikipedia}}
A corruption of "and per se--and," which is how the [[symbol]] was originally referred to in [[English]].
The character itself is a stylized E and T, or ''et'', the Latin word for "[[and]]". Romans used such symbols at least since the first [[century]] AD, but the [[character]] may not have [[acquired]] its present form until the advent of [[calligraphy]] in the Middle Ages.
