===Etymology===
A [[mondegreen]] of "and {{m|la|per se}} and", meaning "and (the character) '&' by itself", which is how the symbol ('''[[&]]''') was originally referred to in [[English]]. This formulation is due to the old practice in schools whereby, when reciting the alphabet, the "&" sign was treated as a 27th letter (read as "and"), and any letter that could also be used as a word in itself ("A", "I", "O" and, at the time, "&") was preceded by the Latin expression {{m|la|per se}} ({{etyl|la|en}} for "by itself"). Thus the end of the recitation would be: "X, Y, Z and per se and". This last phrase eventually became "ampersand", and the term was in common English usage by around 1837.

This is ''and per se and''; by a little smoothing and elision in pronunciation, becoming '''''Ampersand'''''. “The expression,” says the learned author referred to, “is not yet forgotten in the nursery.” No; nor far beyond the nursery. It is remembered and used in the village-school, in the cottage, the shop, and the farm-house. This formula of spelling and putting together was applied to every syllable consisting of one letter only; as we all may remember who learned our first elements on the principles of the old school. Only, indeed, the dame was wont to express ''per se'' in her own English, and teach us to say “''A by the self A''.” The character ''&'' is, however, in fact, originally and properly ''Latin'', and is a combination of the two letters ''e'' and ''t'', which constitute the common conjunction copulative in that language. It has been adopted and transferred into other languages, for the same use, with or without the same propriety. It must be allowed to exhibit stronger traces of its two constituent letters than the majority of those Greek abbreviations, tables of which, more or less copious, are inserted in almost all grammars, and which are so very embarrassing in ancient MSS. and early printed editions. A curious and irrefragable proof of the Latinity of this character in the rich library at Holkham, Norfolk. In a Latin MS. of the Four Gospels, supposed to be of the tenth century, it is used as a part of many words, at the end, and even in the body of them. Instances are, ''posset'' and ''sciretis''; written thus, ''poss&'' and ''scir&is''. There is a multitude of others.}}

Our author thus learnedly explains the riddle. / “The ''fescue'' was a sharpened wire, or other instrument, used by the preceptor to point out the letters to the children. ''Abisselfa'' is a contraction of the words ‘a, by itself, a.’ It was usual, when either of the vowels constituted a syllable of a word, to pronounce it, and denote by its independent character, by the words just mentioned, thus: ‘a by itself, ''a'', c-o-r-n corn, ''acorn''’—e by itself ''e'', v-i-l vil, evil. The character which stands for the word ‘''and''’ (&) was probably pronounced with the same accompaniment, but in terms borrowed from the Latin language, thus: ‘& ''per se'' (by itself) &.’ ‘Hence '''anpersant'''.’”}}

Henkle |pages=122–123 |text=1. '''{{smc|Ampersand}}'''.—This word was formerly much used in nursery books to express the character ''&'' placed at the end of the alphabet. Halliwell says “In Hampshire it is pronounced '''''amperzed''''', and very often '''''amperse’-and'''''.” The word has been called a puzzling word. One writer says that as he heard it it never puzzled him because his venerable instructress taught him to say after ''z'' “'''and-pussy-and'''.” He considered that ''&'' was called ''pussy'' from its resemblance to a cat in a sitting posture. This is certainly a quaint conceit. Another writer’s recollection of the way he pronounced the word when a boy was '''am''puzzy''am'''. Another still says his venerable instructress taught him to pronounce it '''''ampseand'''''. We now give the correct explanation of the word. A quarter of a century ago our maternal grandfather, a native of New Jersey, told us that he was taught to spell ''able'' abisselfa, ''b''-''l''-''e'', bl, ''able'', but he said he never knew what ''abisselfa'' meant. A few years after we found that ''abisselfa'' is a corruption of ''a'' by itself ''a'', that is ''a'' standing by itself in a syllable is pronounced ā and not ă, or ä or a̤. In the same way ''idle'' would be spelled ibisselfi, ''d''-''l''-,''e'' dl, ''idle'' and ''ogle'', obisselfo ''g''-''l''-''e'' gl, ''ogle''. It seems that the Latin phrase ''per se'' was also used instead of ''by itself'' so that instead of ''abisselfa'', ''ibisselfi'', and ''obisselfo'', the children were taught to say a ''per se'' a, i-''per''-''se''-i, and o-''per''-''se''-o. It is not strange that ''per se'' became in the mouths of children ''pussy'' or ''puzzy''. The character ''&'' was in like manner taught as ''and per se and'', which became by corruption ''and pussy se and'', etc., and finally '''''ampersand'''''.}}

Ringwalt’s American Encyclopædia of Printing says that it was not adopted in its present form until about 1750. It was originally the Latin et surmounted by a ligature, and the type founders give it to us in Roman in this form (&), and in old-style italic in this form (''&''). There is a wide difference between the two, and there exists a still wider difference in various display types, while the sign painter takes all sorts of liberties with the figure. The word is a contraction of “and per se and,” signifying “and by itself and.” It is occasionally spelled '''amparzand''', and is found in old books in the form '''ampusand''', '''amperse-and''', '''ampassyand''', '''amperzed''', etc. Having for many years received recognition in primers as a tail-end to the alphabet, and being apparently of fixed use in the language, it becomes interesting to discover what forms it has taken on in arriving at its present shape, if indeed it have any present legitimate state.}}
