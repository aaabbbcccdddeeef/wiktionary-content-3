===Etymology===
A [[mondegreen]] of "and {{m|la|per se}} and", meaning "and (the character) '&' by itself", which is how the symbol ('''[[&]]''') was originally referred to in [[English]]. This formulation is due to the old practice in schools whereby, when reciting the alphabet, the "&" sign was treated as a 27th letter (read as "and"), and any letter that could also be used as a word in itself ("A", "I", "O" and, at the time, "&") was preceded by the Latin expression {{m|la|per se}} ({{etyl|la|en}} for "by itself"). Thus the end of the recitation would be: "X, Y, Z and per se and". This last phrase eventually became "ampersand", and the term was in common English usage by around 1837.

Nichols and Son]] |page=6 |text='''AMPERSAND''', ''s''. the character ''&'', representing the conjunction ''and''. ''V''. {{smc|n. g.}}—''A per se A''. This is ''and per se and''; by a little smoothing and elision in pronunciation, becoming ''Ampersand''. “The expression,” says the learned author referred to, “is not yet forgotten in the nursery.” No; nor far beyond the nursery. It is remembered and used in the village-school, in the cottage, the shop, and the farm-house. This formula of spelling and putting together was applied to every syllable consisting of one letter only; as we all may remember who learned our first elements on the principles of the old school. Only, indeed, the dame was wont to express ''per se'' in her own English, and teach us to say “''A by the self A''.” The character ''&'' is, however, in fact, originally and properly ''Latin'', and is a combination of the two letters ''e'' and ''t'', which constitute the common conjunction copulative in that language. It has been adopted and transferred into other languages, for the same use, with or without the same propriety. It must be allowed to exhibit stronger traces of its two constituent letters than the majority of those Greek abbreviations, tables of which, more or less copious, are inserted in almost all grammars, and which are so very embarrassing in ancient MSS. and early printed editions. A curious and irrefragable proof of the Latinity of this character in the rich library at Holkham, Norfolk. In a Latin MS. of the Four Gospels, supposed to be of the tenth century, it is used as a part of many words, at the end, and even in the body of them. Instances are, ''posset'' and ''sciretis''; written thus, ''poss&'' and ''scir&is''. There is a multitude of others.}}
