#:'''Quotations'''
#:*A concrete name is a name which stands for a thing; an '''abstract''' name which stands for an attribute of a thing. A practice has grown up in more modern times, which, if not introduced by Locke, has gained currency from his example, of applying the expression "'''abstract''' name" to all names which are the result of abstraction and generalization, and consequently to all general names, instead of confining it to the names of attributes. - [[w:John Stuart Mill|John Stuart Mill]]
#Abstracted; absent in mind.
