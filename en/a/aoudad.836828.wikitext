#* '''1995''', Dick Bartlett, ''Saving the Best of Texas: A Partnership Approach to Conservation'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=HuYofGOyUM8C&pg=PA183&dq=%22aoudad%22%7C%22aoudads%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQzDUICJBrCOmQWjkIH4CA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22aoudad%22%7C%22aoudads%22&f=false page 183],
#*: '''Aoudads''' compete with native deer and actually run them off shared range, according to TPWD<sup><nowiki>[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]</nowiki></sup> ethnobotanist David Alloway. There is no doubt that the '''aoudad''' must be removed from the ranch; the only question is how.
#* '''1999''', Ronald M. Nowak, '''''Aoudad''', or Barbary Sheep'', article in ''Walker′s Mammals of the World'', Volume 1, [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=7W-DGRILSBoC&pg=PA1231&dq=%22aoudad%22%7C%22aoudads%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQzDUICJBrCOmQWjkIH4CA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22aoudad%22%7C%22aoudads%22&f=false page 1231],
#*: In captivity the '''aoudad''' seems to like water and to enjoy taking a bath. The diet consists of grass, herbaceous plants, and stunted bushes.
#* '''2007''', Elizabeth Cary Mungall, ''Exotic Animal Field Guide: Nonnative Hoofed Mammals in the United States'', [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=6PR5VWOMrqMC&pg=PA12&dq=%22aoudad%22%7C%22aoudads%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQzDUICJBrCOmQWjkIH4CA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22aoudad%22%7C%22aoudads%22&f=false page 12],
#*: New Mexico addressed this anxiety by issuing game department personnel a shoot-on-sight order for any '''aoudad''' found inside known bighorn boundaries in New Mexico. By comparison, Arizona′s intent was to eliminate any '''aoudad''' loose anywhere inside its jurisdiction, and its neighbor′s other additions were not welcome either.
