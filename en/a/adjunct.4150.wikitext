#*: We can see from (34) that Determiners are sisters of N-bar and daughters of<br> N-double-bar; '''Adjuncts''' are both sisters and daughters of N-bar; and Comple-<br> ments are sisters of N and daughters of N-bar. This means that '''Adjuncts''' re-<br> semble Complements in that both are daughters of N-bar; but they differ from<br> Complements in that '''Adjuncts''' are sisters of N-bar, whereas Complements are<br> sisters of N. Likewise, it means that '''Adjuncts''' resemble Determiners in that<br> both are sisters of N-bar, but they differ from Determiners in that '''Adjuncts'''<br> are daughters of N-bar, whereas Determiners are daughters of N-double-bar.
