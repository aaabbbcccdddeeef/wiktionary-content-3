Plutarch is also wrong: '''Arkhimedes''' ‘deigned’ to write a work ''On sphere-making'' (which is lost), and ''The Method'' (which was rediscovered in 1906). '''Arkhimedes''' developed some of his mathematics using a mechanical method, based on the lever principle, by which he could discover mathematical results, which he then set about proving. Moreover, it is highly significant that '''Arkhimedes''' wrote about his method.}}
