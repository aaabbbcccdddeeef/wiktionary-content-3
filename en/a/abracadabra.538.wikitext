===Etymology===
[[magical|Magical]] word used in certain [[Gnostic]] writings, relation to [[Greek]] [[abraxas|Abraxas]], a Gnostic [[deity]].

It may also be a corruption of the Aramaic term {{lang|he|עַבְדָא כְּדַברָא}}, ''{{lang|he-Ltn|avda kedavra'', which can also be read, ''avda kedabra}},'' which means, "what was said has been done''; or perhaps, {{lang|he|,עברא כדברא}}, ''what has said has come to pass''."  This may be the source of the ''Avada Kedavra'' killing curse in the ''Harry Potter'' books.
