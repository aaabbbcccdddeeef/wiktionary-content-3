===Etymology===
From {{der|en|LL.|abracadabra}}, a word used in magical writings, of uncertain origin. Relationships have been suggested with {{m|en|Abraxas|pos=a Gnostic deity}}, and with various Aramaic or Hebrew terms ({{m|arc|עַבְדָא כְּדַברָא|tr=avda kedavara|lit=what was said has been done}}; {{m|he|עבראכדברא|tr=avra kedavra|lit=what was said has come to pass}}; {{m|he|ארבע-אחד-ארבע}} when it is read from right to left [http://www.scribd.com/doc/14656725/Abracadabra]), but there is little supporting evidence.
