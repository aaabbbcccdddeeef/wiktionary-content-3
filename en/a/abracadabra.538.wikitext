===Etymology===
From {{der|en|LL.|abracadabra}}, a word used in magical writings, of {{unk|en|title=unknown}} origin. Relationships have been suggested with {{m|en|Abraxas|pos=a Gnostic deity}}, and with various Aramaic or Hebrew terms {{m|he|עברא כדברא|tr=avra kedavra|lit=what was said has come to pass}}, {{m|arc|עַבְדָא כְּדַברָא|tr=avda kedavara|lit=what was said has been done}}; {{m|he|ארבע-אחד-ארבע}} (''arba-eḥad-arba'', literally “four-one-four”),<ref>http://www.scribd.com/doc/14656725/Abracadabra</ref> but there is little supporting evidence.
