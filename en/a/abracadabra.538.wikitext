===Etymology===
[[magical|Magical]] word used in certain [[Gnostic]] writings, relation to [[Greek]] [[abraxas|Abraxas]], a Gnostic [[deity]].

It may also be a corruption of the Aramaic term {{Hebr|[[עבדא כדברא|עַבְדָא כְּדַברָא]]}}, ''avda kedavra''; “what was said has been done”; or perhaps, {{Hebr|[[עברא כדברא]]}}, ''avra kedavra''; “what has said has come to pass.”  

It may also be the combination of three hebrew words {{Hebr|[[ארבע-אחד-ארבע]]}} when it is read from right to left [http://www.scribd.com/doc/14656725/Abracadabra] .
 
The Aramaic is the source of the ''Avada Kedavra'' killing curse in the ''Harry Potter'' books.<!-- JK Rowling said this 15 April 2004, at the Edinburgh Book Festival, but referred to the meaning as “let the thing be destroyed”-->
