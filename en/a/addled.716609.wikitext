===Etymology===
1712, from addle (n.) "[[urine]], [[liquid]] [[filth]]," from [[Old English|O.E.]] adela "[[mud]], [[mire]], liquid [[manure]]" ([[cognate]] with [[Old Swedish|O. Swed.]] adel "urine," [[Middle Low German|M.L.G.]] adel, [[Dutch|Du.]] aal "[[puddle]]"). Used in [[noun phrase]] addle egg (mid-13c.) "egg that does not [[hatch]], [[rotten]] egg," lit. "urine egg," a [[loan translation]] of [[Latin|L.]] ovum urinum, which is itself an [[erroneous]] loan translation of [[Greek|Gk.]] ourion oon "putrid egg," lit. "[[wind]] egg," from ourios "of the wind" (confused by Roman writers with ourios "of urine," from ouron "urine"). Because of this usage, the noun in English was taken as an adj. from c.1600, meaning "putrid," and thence given a [[figurative]] [[extension]] to "[[empty]], [[vain]], [[idle]]," also "confused, [[muddled]], [[unsound]]" (1706).
