However, in view of the Western definition of the soul, '''atman''' and soul are not the same.{{...}}In the Western view, the soul is created by God.

#*: The priests who were immersed in the ritual science of the ''Brahmanas'' began to speculate on the nature of the self, and gradually the word "'''atman'''" came to refer to the essential and eternal core of the human person, which made him or her unique.
