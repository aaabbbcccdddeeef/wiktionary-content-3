# A very disruptive internet pirate

Ebo caused EA Sports to change their message board styles and single handedly started the "spam wars" that erupted over ea.com for about two years.

Also, pretty recently Ebo put himself in the [[wikipedia]] database with the whole Anommas Pooter fiasco, the deletion log can still be seen on google.com

and other search engines by typing Anommas Pooter into the search box.
