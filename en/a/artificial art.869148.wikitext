'''Artificial art''' is the automatization of [[art]] production. Described in literature e.g, (Arroyo 2005).

The art considers a specific activity human, for which it resorts to certain sensorial faculties, aesthetic and intellectual. The computers have certain sensorial faculty (sounds by the microphone, tact by the keyboard, etc) and next to the Genetic Programming and Artificial Neuronal Networks (branches of the Artificial intelligence) certain level of aesthetic and intellectual faculty is obtained. This it is the frame in which we spoke of Artificial Art. [[User:200.40.96.70|200.40.96.70]] 13:36, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
