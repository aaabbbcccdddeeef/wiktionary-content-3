# A [[political]] [[philosophy]] [[opposed]] to the [[separation]] of a [[religious]] [[group]] (church) and a [[government]] (state), especially the belief held by those in 19th [[century]] [[England]] [[opposed]] to separating the Anglican church from the [[civil]] government or to refer to separation of church and state. {{defdate|from 20th c.}}

#* {{quote-book|en|year=2002|author=Angela Hague and David Lavery (credited as editors, but actually authors of the compiled fictional reviews)|title=Teleparody: predicting/preventing the TV discourse of tomorrow|text=The establishmentarianism of Hatch's alliance-building strategy undermined by the disestablishmentarianism of Wiglesworth's treachery triggers an '''antidisestablishmentarianism''' in Hawk &mdash; but the negation of Wiglesworth's 'dis' coupled with the counter-negation of Hawk's 'anti' does not simply generate a synthetic affirmation of Hatch's 'establishmentarianism'. Instead, Hawk's '''antidisestablishmentarianism''', like a cancerous wart on the end of the nose, is perched at the fuzzy border separating [[ontology]] from [[oncology]], [[malignity]] from [[malignancy]].}}

Known as a superlatively long word, it is, with 28 letters and 12 syllables, probably the longest non-technical and non-contrived word in English. The jocular term {{m|en|floccinaucinihilipilification}} is one letter longer.
