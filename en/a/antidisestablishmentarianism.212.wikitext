{{en-noun|-}}

# A [[political]] [[philosophy]] [[opposed]] to the [[separation]] of a [[religious]] [[group]] ("[[church]]") and a [[government]] ("[[state]]"), especially the belief held by those in 19th [[century]] [[England]] [[opposed]] to separating the Anglican church from the [[civil]] government or to refer to separation of church and state. {{defdate|from 20th c.}}
#* '''1998''', University of Oklahoma College of Law, ''American Indian Law Review'':
#*: Jed Rubenfeld, who actually may not have been recycling a ''Boerne'' Court- rejected argument into a law review article,<sup>450</sup> reasoned that RFRA indeed lacked constitutionality, but because of First Amendment '''antidisestablishmentarianism''', and not the reasons offered by the Court.<sup>451</sup>
#* '''2002''', Angela Hague and David Lavery (credited as editors, but truly authors of the compiled fictional reviews), ''Teleparody: predicting/preventing the TV discourse of tomorrow''
#*: The establishmentarianism of Hatch's alliance-building strategy undermined by the disestablishmentarianism of Wiglesworth's treachery triggers an '''antidisestablishmentarianism''' in Hawk &mdash; but the negation of Wiglesworth's 'dis' coupled with the counter-negation of Hawk's 'anti' does not simply generate a synthetic affirmation of Hatch's 'establishmentarianism'. Instead, Hawk's '''antidisestablishmentarianism''', like a cancerous wart on the end of the nose, is perched at the fuzzy border separating [[ontology]] from [[oncology]], [[malignity]] from [[malignancy]].
