=== Etymology ===
The word ''anarchy'' came into [[English language|English]] from the [[New Latin]] term ''[[anarchia]]'' but derives ultimately from the Greek ''[[αναρχία]]'', whose roots are &alpha;&nu;(&alpha;), ''an(a)'', "without", and &alpha;&rho;&chi;(&omicron;&sigmaf;), ''arkh(os)'', "ruler, authority".

===Noun===
'''anarchy'''

# absence of [[hierarchy]], [[power]] and [[authority]]
# absence of any form of political authority or [[government]]
# political disorder and confusion
# absence of any cohesive principle, such as a common standard or purpose
# without rules or laws (syn: [[anomie]], [[anomy]])
# self-government

'''Note:'''  As [[anarchists]] use it, "anarchy" does not imply chaos or anomie, but rather a harmonious anti-authoritarian society.  In fact, anarchist conceptions of such a society (such as those of [[anarcho-syndicalists]]) often include a high degree of societal structure.
