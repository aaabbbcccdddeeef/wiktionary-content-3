=== Etymology ===
[[New Latin]] term ''[[anarchia]]'' < Greek ''[[αναρχία]]''< &alpha;&nu;(&alpha;), ''an(a)'', "without", and &alpha;&rho;&chi;(&omicron;&sigmaf;), ''arkh(os)'', "ruler, authority".

===Noun===
'''anarchy'''

# absence of [[hierarchy]], [[power]] and [[authority]]
# absence of any form of political authority or [[government]]
# political disorder and confusion
# absence of any cohesive principle, such as a common standard or purpose
# without rules or laws (syn: [[anomie]], [[anomy]])
# self-government

'''Note:'''  As [[w:Anarchism | anarchists]] use it, "anarchy" does not imply chaos or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious anti-authoritarian society.  In fact, anarchist conceptions of such a society (such as those of [[w:Anarcho-syndicalism | anarcho-syndicalists]]) often include a high degree of societal structure.
