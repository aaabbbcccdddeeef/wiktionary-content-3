#* '''1658''', [[w:Thomas Browne|Thomas Browne]], ''[[s:The Garden of Cyrus|The Garden of Cyrus]]'', chapter 1:
#*: We will not revive the mysterious crosses of Ægypt, with circles on their heads, in the breast of Serapis, and the hands of their Geniall spirits, not unlike the characters of Venus, and looked on by ancient Christians, with relation unto Christ. Since however they first began, the '''Ægyptians''' thereby expressed the processe and motion of the spirit of the world, and the diffusion thereof upon the Celestiall and Elementall nature; implyed by a circle and right‐lined intersection.
