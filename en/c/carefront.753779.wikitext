Carefronting is the "caring confronting" of an invidual. To carefront someone is to approach them in love and respect and correct them in an honoring manner.

The word "carefront" comes from the Greek word "''karioklesis''" which means "to lovingly and respectfully approach another". It also has implications of that person being someone who has wronged you personally or has wronged someone that is in close relationship with you, either by blood or by friendship.

Anyone has the ability to carefront.

To determine whether carefronting is a viable option, these "how's" are to be observed: 
-Is it with a right motive?
-Is it a private process between the carefrontor and the carefrontee?
-Is the carefronting done in a personal way?
-Is there provision to resolve the issue?
-Can the carefront be done in a pointed way?

In conclusion, carefronting is always a viable and useful option in any situation where a wrong has been done to an individual.
