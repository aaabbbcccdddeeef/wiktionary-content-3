===Verb===
{{en-verb}}

# A risky maneuver whereby a sail-boat [[tacks]] (turns sharply into the wind) by dropping one of the front anchors, the intent being to snag the anchor on the seabed and use the ship's momentum to swing it around faster than could otherwise be accomplished; it is essentially a nautical [[handbrake]] turn.
