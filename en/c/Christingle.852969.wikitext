The language used to describe a '''Christingle''' has changed over time but fundamentally a '''Christingle''' is a candle set into an orange, respectively representing the world and Jesus. A red ribbon is tied around the orange, representing the blood of Christ. Fruit and sweets on four cocktail sticks are also set in the orange, representing the four seasons and God's love in providing the fruits of the earth. {{...}} This service was performed in local churches all over Moravia when families would gather together at Christmas time. In the first service, the children were encouraged to take their '''Christingle''' home to re-light and place in their cottage to show the light of Christ to passers by.}}
