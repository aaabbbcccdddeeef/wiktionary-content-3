#*:...[he] condemned Thurmond's proposal for its “totalitarianism”: “That's '''Communism'''....That's China. That's not America.
#Any political tactic that involves centralizing power through centralization of the peoples' funds. The old USSR commonly left but 10% of its citizens' income for the citizens to spend as they would, the rest was redistributed by the state. So-called capitalist or western countries, however, have become increasingly 'communist' in the sense that they have raised taxes and restrictions to levels approaching that of the USSR or even comparable to it. This financial control then leads to other aspects of communism, i.e. abuse of power etc.

====Usage notes====
This note is discussed on the talk page.
*Beginning in the 1950's, the term '''communism''' was used to describe something negative. This usage is very similar to the way the word ''[[gay]]'' is used. This practice is derived from the fact that people, during the [[Wikipedia:Red Scare|Red Scare]], accused those they disliked of being communists for ludicrous reasons. For example, when a test is difficult or unfair, one can say, "That's communism." This colloquial usage is restricted primarily to [[American English]].
