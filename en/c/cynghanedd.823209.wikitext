# {{lb|en|prosody}} The complex system of internal [[assonance]], [[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]] in Welsh strict-meter poetry.
#* '''1948''' (revised 1952), Robert Graves, ''The White Goddess'', Faber & Faber 1999, p. 14:
#*: Only certain epithets and metaphors were authorized; themes were similarly restricted, metres fixed, and '''''Cynghanedd''''', the repetitive use of consonantal sequences with variation of vowels, became a burdensome obsession.
#* Britannica Online Encyclopedia:
#*: There are four fundamental types of '''''cynghanedd''''', but within these there are a number of refinements and variations. When skillfully used, '''''cynghanedd''''' is capable of conveying an almost unlimited variety of subtle effects.
