GENERAL DESCRIPTION ABOUT EN29F800
The [url=http://www.chinaicmart.com/suppliers/301/EN29F800.html][/url] is a 8-Megabit, electrically erasable, read/write non-volatile flash memory, organized as 1,048,576 bytes or 524,288 words. Any byte can be programmed typically in 10Âµs. The EN29F800 features 5.0V voltage read and write operation, with access times as fast as 45ns to eliminate the need for WAIT states in high-performance microprocessor systems.The EN29F800 has separate Output Enable (OE), Chip Enable (CE), and Write Enable (WE) controls, which eliminate bus contention issues. This device is designed to allow either single (or multiple) Sector or full chip erase operation, where each Sector can be individually protected against program/erase operations or temporarily unprotected to erase or program. The device can sustain a minimum of 100K program/erase cycles on each Sector.
