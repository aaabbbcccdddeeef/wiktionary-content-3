{{en-noun|sg=[[classical]] [[unemployment]]|-}}

# {{economics}} A type of [[unemployment]] explained by the wages being higher than the [[market-equilibrium]] wage.  This kind of situation is suggested to arise e.g. as a result of a too generous [[minimum wage]] law or labour union influence.
#:''There can be "[[Keynesian]]" and '''"classical" unemployment'''. Indeed there can be both at the same time: the real wage might be too high to allow full employment with existing capital stock, while at the same time aggregate demand is inadequate to take off the market what firms would wish to produce. Changes in the real wage could have demand-side and supply-side effects.'' [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1987/solow-lecture.html] Nobel prize winner Robert M. Solow in his prize lecture on Dec 8th, 1987.
