====Usage notes====
* Unlike any of [[creature#Related terms|its related terms]], ''creature'' has not retained the original [[syllabic break]] between the ‘e’ and the ‘a’ (as “cre'''·'''ature”), having instead undergone [[synæresis]]. For this reason, its original sense of “something created” is not always evident to those who hear its modern, [[disyllabic]] pronunciation.
* Some authors and translators (especially of poetical works) write a [[diæresis]] atop the ‘a’, thereby specifying the original [[trisyllabic]] pronunciation, either for [[metrical]] reasons in [[poetry]], or to remind the listener or reader of the original meaning of ''creature''.
