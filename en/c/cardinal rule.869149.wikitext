A '''cardinal rule''' is a fundamental rule, upon which other matters hinge. 

Cardinal as an adjective derives principally from the Latin ''cardo'', or "hinge", so that something cardinal is important because all else hinges upon it.  In the same manner, a cardinal direction is one of the principal directions: north, south, east or west. This term was first used to describe the [[cardinal virtues]], however by the mid fifteenth century had acquired a more general usage.<ref>http://www.takeourword.com/TOW129/page2.html</ref> 

Originally, a cardinal in the religious sense was an officer of the clergy, the word deriving from Latin ''cardinalis'', or "clergyman", purportedly first used in 1125. The etymological link is that a clergyman is attached to the Church much as a door is attached to a building by its hinges.  The word gradually shifted so that it applied only to the higher-ranking members of the Roman Catholic clergy, the men known today as cardinals.<ref>http://www.takeourword.com/TOW129/page2.html</ref>
