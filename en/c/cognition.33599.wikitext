'''cognition'''
#The process of knowing.
#The process of knowing in human cognition may be understood in terms of a complex interplay of four contributing (discrete subsystems, dynamically interacting) components: (i) a conditioned framing of attention ('pure consciousness') that downrates 'interrupts' and 'distracts' in favour of ''interest'' in perceptual information quality; (ii) a dynamic system of brain control in learning (the Cognitive Process Consciousness ''model''); (iii) a dependent transformational developmental framework where experience is repackaged into fast-access knowledge (The CPC ''framework'' of the mind); and (iv) a weakly interacting two-part bifurcation of knowledge itself into concepts/ideas and theories/knowhow repositories that are relevant to tasking. Human cognition may be understood as a self-activating dynamic system operating over these four components, by the addition of two further 'activating' principles: (a) the systematic preservation of attentive resource by use of successive vehicles of cognitive compression over the familiar (imparting autonomy); and (b) acknowledging a third aspect ('directed pointers') intrinsic to the role of 'linguistic symbols' (complementing the sense and denotative aspects) in imparting an adaptive directedness (imparting activation).
