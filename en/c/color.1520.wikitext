*{{AHD|/kŭl'ər/}}

*{{SAMPA|"kVl@}}
*{{audio|en-us-color.ogg|Audio (US)}}

===Alternative spellings===
*[[colour]] ''(Commonwealth English)''
'''Note''' - The spelling "color" is the spelling preferred by most native English speakers of the US.  <!-- Originally the spelling of 'colour' without a U was a sanctioned change of the Spelling Reformist Movement, which was not exclusively accepted by Americans, but was much more popular in the US than in other countries where English is the native language.  When the movement died out, its changes remained in US English but not in British English and related variants, such as Commonwealth English. -->

===Etymology===
From Old French '''[[coulour]]''', from Latin '''color'''.  In American spelling the 'u' was dropped from [[colour]] to simplify the spelling. In British spelling the 'u' remains.
