===Usage note===
The late Anglo-French ''colour'', which is the standard UK spelling, has been the usual spelling in Britain since the 14th century and was chosen by [[w:Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson]]'s ''[[w:A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755) along with other Anglo-French spellings such as [[favour]], [[honour]], etc. The Latin spelling ''color'' was occasionally used from the 15th century onward, mainly due to Latin influence; it was lemmatized by [[w:Noah Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[w:Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1828), along with [[favor]], [[honor]], etc., and is currently the standard U.S. spelling. 

In Canada, ''colour'' is preferred, but ''color'' is not unknown; in Australia, ''-our'' endings are the standard, although ''-or'' endings had some currency in the past and are still sporadically found in some regions.
