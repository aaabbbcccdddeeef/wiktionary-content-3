The etymology is not known.  One theory is that it was named after its inventor, but there is no evidence for this.  Another theory claims that it is a blending of the French words CONtraceptif DOMicile, which translates as "home contraceptive".  Another theory says that it is from Italian ''guantone'', from [[guanto]] ('''glove''').
