<br>
'''''Carcase''''' may be more common in varieties of British English than it is in US English. For instance, in Australia, some newspapers use {{term|carcase|lang=en}}, while others use '''''carcass'''''. The Australian Dept of Agriculture uses '''''carcase''''' for the sense ''body of slaughtered animal''.<ref>'''1995''', Pam Peters, ''The Cambridge Australian English Style Guide''.</ref>
