===Etymology===
[[File:Playing with hands.JPG|thumb|A community ''(sense 1)'' can be made up of people of different [[race#Noun|races]]]]

From Late {{inh|en|enm|communite|commū̆nitẹ̄}},<ref>{{R:MED Online|entry=commū̆nitẹ̄|id=MED8643|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> borrowed from {{bor|en|fro|communité}}, {{m|fro|comunité}}, {{m|en|comunete}} (modern {{cog|fr|communauté}}), from Classical {{der|en|la|commūnitās||community; public spirit}},<ref>{{R:OED Online|entry=community|code=37337|part of speech=n}}</ref> from {{m|la|commūnis||common, ordinary; of or for the community, public}} + {{m|la|-itās}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*-teh₂ts||''suffix forming nouns indicating a state of being''}}). ''Commūnis'' is derived from {{m|la|con-||''prefix indicating a being or bringing together of several objects''}} (from {{m|la|cum||with}}, ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*ḱóm||along, at, next to, with}}) + {{m|la|mūnus||employment, office, service; burden, duty, obligation}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*mey-||to change, exchange}}).
