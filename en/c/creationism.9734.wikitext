# The creationary beliefs of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]].
# The [[theological]] controversy concerning the origin of the human species, and other living beings, and especially questioning in what sense if any the creationary acts of God are considered a matter of historical fact
