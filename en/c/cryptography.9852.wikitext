{{en-noun|-}}

# The [[discipline]] concerned with [[communication]] [[security]] (eg, [[confidentiality]] of messages, [[integrity]] of messages, sender [[authentication]], non-[[repudiation]] of messages, and many other related issues), regardless of the used medium such as pencil and paper or computers.
#* '''1658:''', [[w:Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] (first use in English),
#*: We might abate...the strange '''cryptography''' of Gaffarell in his Starrie Booke of Heaven.

====Usage notes====
Subfields include [[encode|encoding]], [[decode|decoding]], [[cryptanalysis]], [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, etc.

In many languages, though less so in English, cognates to "cryptology" are also used with the meaning given above, and even preferred. Cryptography is also somewhat related to [[steganography]] which is concerned with concealing the very existence of a message. Contrast this with cryptography's indifference, from a confidentiality viewpoint, to whether a message is copied by some attacker.

====Derived terms====
