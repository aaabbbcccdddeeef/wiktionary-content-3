===Noun===
'''conveyances'''

# {{plural of|[[conveyance]]}}
Once the chain of title is established, the title attorney must review the Grantor indices held at the County Register of Deeds office to determine all out conveyances of record made by each of the prior owners of the property. This is done to insure that none of the prior owners ever conveyed the subject property (or a portion of it) previously. This can mean checking five to ten out conveyances on up to several hundred, depending on the activity of any of the former owners. Additionally, checking the "outs" will establish the outstanding deeds of trust against the property, which must be paid off before the Buyer can obtain clear record title
