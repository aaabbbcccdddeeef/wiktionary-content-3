===Etymology 1===
Etymology uncertain. Occurs in print at least as early as 1831, when [[Wikipedia:Samuel Lover|Samuel Lover]] used the [[expression]] as one already long-[[establish]]ed. He [[unambiguous]]ly stated the [[derivation]] of ''cess'' in the [[malediction]] ''bad cess'' to be an abbreviation of {{m|en|success}}.<ref>Lover, Samuel: Legends and Stories of Ireland. 1831 Publishers Wakeman, Dublin; Baldwin and Cradock, London; Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh.</ref>. OED [[speculate]]d that it either was from ''success'' or from ''[[assessment]]'' meaning a military or governmental [[exaction]].<ref name= "OEDJHM">Murray, J.A.H.
