* [[cod's wallop]]

===Etymology===
{{unk.|en}}, attested from 1959 episode of UK TV series ''[[w:Hancock's Half Hour|Hancock’s Half Hour]].'' The writers ({{w|Galton and Simpson}}) state that the phrase was in general use when the show was broadcast.<ref name="pf">{{R:Phrase Finder|codswallop|A load of codswallop}}</ref><ref name="oed">[http://web.archive.org/web/20090305064036/http://oed.com/bbcwords/codswallop-new.html codswallop], DRAFT REVISON Jan. 2006, OED Online, archived from [http://oed.com/bbcwords/codswallop-new.html original] on 2009–03–09</ref> A national TV appeal in the UK in 2006 failed to find earlier references.<ref name="pf"/> Originally written (1963) '''codswallop''', spelling {{term|cod's wallop|lang=en}} is later.

Various etymologies are proposed from some sense of {{term|cod|lang=en}}, such as from {{term|cod||scrotum|lang=en}} (as in {{term|codpiece|lang=en}}), from {{term|cod||joke, imitation|lang=en}}<ref name="pf"/> + {{term|wallop||beer (slang)|lang=en}}, hence ''cod'' + ''wallop'' “imitation beer” (with [[interconsonantal]] ''-s-'' to ease pronunciation of ''-dw-''), or from {{term|cod||fish|lang=en}} (some part of the fish, as from fishing industry).

A frequently given etymology, rejected as a [[folk etymology]], derives it from {{w|Hiram Codd}}, British soft drink maker of the 1870s, known for the eponymous {{w|Codd-neck bottle}}, with the suggestion that '''codswallop''' is a derisive term for soft drinks by beer drinkers, from ''Codd’s'' + {{term|wallop||beer (slang)|lang=en}} “Codd’s beer (sarcastic)”. This is widely rejected – there is no evidence that early uses had this sense, the slang {{term|wallop||beer|lang=en}} comes later than Codd’s lifetime,<ref name="pf"/> initial spellings (1963 in print) do not reflect such a derivation (*''Codd’s wallop'' and *''coddswallop'' with ''-dd-'' are not found), and there is an 80 year gap between proposed coinage and attestation.

This is also the name given to the wooden device placed over the neck of a codd bottle and given a push (wallop) to dislodge the marble in the neck of the bottle. The word has also been used to describe the process of opening a codd bottle.
