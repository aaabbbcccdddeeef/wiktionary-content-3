===Etymology===
{{unk|en}}, attested from 1959 episode of UK TV series ''{{w|Hancock's Half Hour}}''. The writers ({{w|Galton and Simpson}}) state that the phrase was in general use when the show was broadcast.<ref name="pf">{{R:Phrase Finder|entry=A load of codswallop|url=codswallop|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref><ref name="oed">{{cite-web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305064036/http://oed.com/bbcwords/codswallop-new.html|url=http://oed.com/bbcwords/codswallop-new.html|archivedate=2009–03–09|year=2006|month=January|title=codswallop|work=OED Online}}</ref> A national TV appeal in the UK in 2006 failed to find earlier references,<ref name="pf"/> though a humorous newspaper column from 1947 does use the fictional name "Sir Aubrey Codswallop".<ref>{{cite-journal |work=Reveille |page=5 |date=1947-07-22 |title=The Man Himself |author="Dee" |location=London |quote=What sort of a man is Sir Aubrey Codswallop, the big noise behind the new Utility Mousetrap (Control of Cheese) Order?}}</ref>  Originally written (1963) {{m|en||codswallop}}, spelling {{m|en|cod's wallop}} is later.

Various etymologies are proposed from some sense of {{m|en|cod}}, such as from {{af|en|cod|t1=joke, imitation|-s-|wallop|t3=beer (slang)}}, hence ''cod'' + ''wallop'' “imitation beer” (with [[interconsonantal]] ''-s-'' to ease pronunciation of ''-dw-''), or from {{af|en|cod|t1=scrotum, as in {{m|en|codpiece}}|-s-|wallop|t3=to hit}}, hence ''cod'' + ''wallop'' “testicle bag”  or "tbag" or "hit with testicle bag," or from {{m|en|cod||fish}} (some part of the fish, as from fishing industry).

A frequently given etymology, although widely rejected as a {{glossary|folk etymology}}, derives it from {{w|Hiram Codd}}, British soft drink maker of the 1870s, known for the eponymous {{w|Codd-neck bottle}}, with the suggestion that {{m|en||codswallop}} is a derisive term for soft drinks by beer drinkers, from ''Codd’s'' + {{m|en|wallop||beer (slang)}} “Codd’s beer (sarcastic)”. There is no evidence that early uses had this sense, the slang {{m|en|wallop||beer}} comes later than Codd’s lifetime,<ref name="pf"/> initial spellings (1963 in print) do not reflect such a derivation (*''Codd’s wallop'' and *''coddswallop'' with ''-dd-'' are not found), and there is an 80-year gap between proposed coinage and attestation.

This is also the name given to the wooden device placed over the neck of a codd bottle and given a push (wallop) to dislodge the marble in the neck of the bottle. The word has also been used to describe the process of opening a codd bottle.
