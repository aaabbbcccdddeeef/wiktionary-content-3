'''Counterknowledge''' is misinformation packaged to look like fact. The claims of counterknowledge, such as those made by [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorians]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientists]], can be identified because there are facts to contradict them, or because there is no evidence to support them. Systems of counterknowledge can appear sophisticated, even internally consistent, but ultimately they are 'systems of counterfactual belief'.[http://www.thewormbook.com/helmintholog/archives/2007/06/13/a_snippet_from.html]

Counterknowledge encourages and takes advantage of a lowering of the standards of proof in society generally. It is often, but not always, disseminated for material gain, as in the cases of 'Dr' [[Gillian McKeith]]'s nutritional advice and [[Gavin Menzies]]' controversial [[1421 hypothesis]].

Further examples of counterknowledge are [[intelligent design]], medical [[quackery]] and [[9/11 conspiracy theories]]. [[Creationism]] is counterknowledge, as it makes demonstrably false scientific claims. Many religious teachings - such as, for example, the doctrine of the Holy Trinity - are not counterknowledge, because their claims are metaphysical (and ultimately unverifiable).
