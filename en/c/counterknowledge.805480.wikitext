'''Counterknowledge''' is misinformation packaged to look like fact. Counterknowledge claims can be identified because there are facts to contradict them, or because there is no evidence to support them. Systems of counterknowledge can appear sophisticated, and even internally consistent, but ultimately they are 'mendacious systems of counterfactual belief'.[http://www.thewormbook.com/helmintholog/archives/2007/06/13/a_snippet_from.html]

Examples of counterknowledge are [[intelligent design]], medical [[quackery]] and [[9/11 conspiracy theories]]. [[Creationism]] is counterknowledge, as it makes demonstrably false scientific claims, whereas the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is not, because its concerns are metaphysical (and ultimately unverifiable).

Counterknowledge encourages and takes advantage of a lowering of the standards of proof in society generally. It is often, but not always, disseminated for material gain (see [[Gillian McKeith]]).

The term was coined by Damian Thompson, a leader writer for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', in [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1843546752/ his book of the same name].
