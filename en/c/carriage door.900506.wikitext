'''Carriage door''' is a term derived from the existence of carriage houses before the days of the automobile.  Carriage houses were a building in which to park one's horse carriage.  A Carriage Door would be the doors of the carriage house.  Today, the use of the word "carriage door" refers to garage doors that are reminiscent of the looks and styles of the original Carriage House doors. 

With the introduction of the car, Carriage Doors were replaced with "convenient" sliding overhead doors.  Carriage doors sometimes sagged because they were large and the inconvenience of getting out of your car led to the popularity of sliding overhead doors with automatic openers.

However, due to a return to old architectural styles, some home owners now put swing out "carriage doors" on their garages. They do so to return to the old look of times past
