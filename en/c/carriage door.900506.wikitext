'''Carriage door''' is a term derived from the existence of carriage houses before the days of the automobile. Carriage houses were a building in which to park one's horse carriage. A Carriage Door would be the doors of the carriage house. Today, the use of the word "carriage door" refers to garage doors that are reminiscent of the looks and styles of the original Carriage House doors. Carriage Doors went out of style with the introduction of the car and were replaced with "convenient" sliding overhead doors. Carriage doors also sagged because they were large and the inconvenience of getting out of your car led to the popularity of sliding overhead doors with automatic openers.
