The term Carriage door refers to the existence of carriage houses before the days of the automobile. Carriage houses were a building in which to park one's horse carriage. A Carriage Door would be the doors of the carriage house. Today, the use of the word "carriage door" refers to garage doors that are reminiscent of the looks and styles of the original Carriage House doors. Carriage Doors went out of style with the introduction of the car and were replaced with "convenient" sliding overhead doors. Carriage doors also sagged because they were large and the inconvenience of getting out of your car has lead to the popularity of sliding overhead doors with automatic openers.

Recently there has been a resurgence of businesses building real carriage doors that swing outward. Many homeowners see the value in returning to the Traditional roots of Carriage Doors.

One such company, the Real Carriage Door Company, [http://www.realcarriagedoors.com/], has returned to the tradition of building handcrafted swing-out carriage doors with the convenience of automatic openers. This company has started a revolution in carriage door building.
