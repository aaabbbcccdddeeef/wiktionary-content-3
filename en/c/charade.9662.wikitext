===Noun===
{{fr-noun}}

# A common word guessing [[riddle]], where the word (or little phrase) to guess is divided in several parts phonetically corresponding each to another word, which are each to be guessed individually (usually from a verbal clue or description), before being able to form the whole word or phrase to guess. <br /> For instance, in its typical verbal form literally translated: "My first can cut wood, my second is on the face, my third holds the sails on a boat, and my whole was first silent but can now talk"; in this ''charade'', the parts to guess are the French words ''[[scie#French|scie]]'' (/si/, can cut wood), ''[[nez#French|nez]]'' (/ne/, on the face), and ''[[mât#French|mât]]'' (/mɑ/, holds the sails on a boat), and the word to guess is ''[[cinéma#French|cinéma]]'' (/si.ne.ma/, was first silent but can now talk).
