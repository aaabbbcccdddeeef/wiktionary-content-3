{{en-noun|~}}

# {{lb|en|sometimes|_|proscribed}} {{alternative spelling of|en|cancellation}}

====Usage notes====
Despite the widely used form of {{m|en|canceled}} vs. {{m|en|cancelled}} in American English, the word ''cancellation'' is still much more widely used than the variant ''cancelation''. The usage of two ''l''s is a remnant of British English, remaining even after American English instated spelling changes<ref>https://www.merriam-webster.com/about-us/spelling-reform</ref>.
