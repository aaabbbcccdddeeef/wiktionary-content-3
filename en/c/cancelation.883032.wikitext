# {{alternative spelling of|cancellation|lang=en}}

====Usage notes====
Despite the widely used form of ''canceled'' vs. ''cancelled'' in American English, the word ''cancellation'' is still much more widely used than the variant ''cancelation''.

The usage of two ''l''s is a remnant of British English, remaining even after American English instated spelling changes<ref>https://www.merriam-webster.com/about-us/spelling-reform</ref>.

Regardless, the choice to spell the word as either ''cancellation'' or ''cancelation'' is entirely arbitrary.
