# {{alternative spelling of|cancellation}}

====Usage notes====
Rarely used outside the US. According to graphs that show the popularity of cancelation vs. cancellation in the US, cancelation is almost 3 times as common in the US after the 80s.

British English spelling rules as regards doubling of final consonants when preceded by a vowel state that a final consonant after an E is generally doubled when further endings are added ('ed', 'ing', and other suffixes) ONLY when the vowel-consonant syllable is the stressed syllable in the root word. 
Examples: Comp'''el''' > Compe'''ll'''ing, Ref'''er''' > Refe'''rr'''ing, Refe'''rr'''al

Since the verb ''''Can'''cel' is stressed on the first syllable then, in theory, the final L '''should not be doubled'''. 

However, as in other cases, the US spelling does not follow these rules. Both spellings, Cancelation and Cancellation, are however accepted as correct.
