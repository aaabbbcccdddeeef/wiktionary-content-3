====Usage notes====
Despite the widely used form of "canceled" vs. "cancelled" in American English, the word "cancellation" is still much more widely used than the variant "cancelation".

The reason for the confusion: When you turn the verb “cancel” into past tense, the word stays the same number of syllables (two), so it’s a matter of location whether you use two L’s or one. The -ation that turns the word into a noun, on the other hand, puts a whole new syllable (in fact, two) after the L. The double-L is a like a bridge to those new syllables.
