'''Clonotype''' is a botanical term used for [[herbarium]] specimens made from plants vegetatively propagated from (and thus clones of) the same plant from which a [[type specimen]] was made.  Clonotypes are of some use in documenting a type collection but have no status under the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]].  The term is sometimes also used to refer to the living plants themselves.
