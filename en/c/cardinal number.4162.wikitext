===Note on usage of cardinal numbers===
*Cardinal numbers are generally construed as ''[[noun]]s'' but function as ''[[adjective]]s''.  When functioning as adjectives, a cardinal number may only precede a {{countable}} noun, and the noun will be plural, except for ''one'' or ''1'':
*:''zero dog'''s''' ''
*:''one cat''
*:''one hundred one dalmatian'''s''' ''
*Cardinal numbers may be used as [[ordinal number]]s when followed or preceded by a singular {{countable}} noun, especially if preceded by the word ''number'' or ''the'':
*:''The five dog was injured.''
*:''That is our number one cat.''
*:''That is our house three.''
*''One'' and ''zero'' can serve as quantifiers indicating effectively ''all'' and ''none'', respectively:
*:''The law requires residency of one year.''
*:''It has zero fat.''
* Cardinal numbers from ''1'' to ''10'' can serve as informal rating description or value, with a scale of 1 to 10 implied; 0 and numbers bigger than 10 are used for [[hyperbole]]:
*:''Bo was once considered a 10.''
*:''The pain is 1.''
