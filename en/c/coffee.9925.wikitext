===Etymology===
From {{bor|en|nl|koffie|t=coffee}}, from {{der|en|it|caffè|t=coffee}}, from {{der|en|ota|قهوه|tr=kahve||coffee}}, from {{der|en|ar|قَهْوَة||coffee, a brew}}.<ref name="OnlineED">{{R:Online Etymology Dictionary|entry=coffee}}</ref><ref name="OxfordED">{{R:OED Online|entry=coffee|pos=n|id=35784|date=June 2021}}</ref> The Arabic word originally referred to wine, a drink which was traditionally mixed and served hot in a similar manner. In Arabic "to brew" utilizes the same triliteral root as wine and intoxicant; see {{ar-root|خ|م|ر|nocat=1}} "to cover over", presumably with hot water. Other sources instead claim it traces back to the name of the {{w|Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa region of Ethiopia}}, which is an {{der|en|omv}} word. {{doublet|en|café|caffè}} and cognate with the words for "coffee" in other major European languages, most of which are derived from the Turkish and Italian words.<ref name="OxfordED"/>
