===Etymology===
From {{bor|en|nl|koffie|t=coffee}} {{defdate|from 1582}}, from {{der|en|ota|قهوه|tr=kahve||coffee}}, from {{der|en|ar|قَهْوَة||coffee, a brew}}. The Arabic word originally referred to wine, a drink which was traditionally mixed and served hot in a similar manner. In Arabic "to brew" utilizes the same triliteral root as wine and intoxicant; see {{ar-root|خ|م|ر|nocat=1}} to cover over, presumably with hot water. Other sources instead claim it traces back to the name of the {{w|Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa region of Ethiopia}}, which is an {{der|en|omv}} word. {{doublet|en|café|caffè}}.
