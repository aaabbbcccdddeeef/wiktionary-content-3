===Alternative forms===
* [[copasetic]]

===Etymology===
{{unk.}}. Many theories exist, all of which lack supporting evidence:<ref>{{R:Dictionary.com|copacetic}}</ref>
* That the term originated among African Americans in the Southern US in the early 20th century or late 19th century—perhaps specifically in the jargon of [[w:Bill Robinson|Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]] (who certainly popularized it, in any case).<ref>Mark Knowles, ''Tap Roots: The Early History of Tap Dancing'' (ISBN 0786412674), page 239</ref>
* That it derives from {{etyl|frc|-}} {{term||coup esètique|lang=fr}} / {{term||coupersètique|capable of being coped with successfully; able to cope with anything and everything|lang=fr}}.<ref name="Gold">this theory is mentioned by David L Gold, ''Studies in Etymology and Etiology'', pages 60-61; he views it with skepticism</ref>
* That it derives from a word *{{term||copasetti|lang=it}} used by {{etyl|it|-}} speakers in New York.<ref name="Gold"></ref>
* That it derives from {{etyl|chn|-}} {{term||copasenee|everything is satisfactory|lang=chn}}<ref>Donald L. Martin makes this suggestion, which can be found in e.g. ''Cassell's Dictionary of Slang'' (2005)</ref> — if the Chinook Jargon term is not itself derived from English.<ref>David L Gold writes of the suggestion that the English term derives from Chinook Jargon: "If that explanation is right, we expect the English word to have first been used somewhere from Alaska to Oregon (the area where Chinook Jargon was spoken). No evidence available to me, however, points in that direction. Might the Chinook Jargon word actually be a reflex of American English ''copacetic'' (in whatever spelling)?"</ref>

The common suggestion that the term derives from Hebrew {{term||[[כל#Hebrew|הכל]] <!--x--> [[סדר#Hebrew|בסדר]]|everything is in order|lang=he|tr=hakól b'séder}} has been rejected, as has the fanciful suggestion that it derives from criminals' observation that they could go about their business because "the cop is on the settee".<ref name="Gold 2">David L Gold, ''Studies in Etymology and Etiology'', pages 60-61</ref>
