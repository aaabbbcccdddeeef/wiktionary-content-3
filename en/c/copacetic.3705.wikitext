* [[copasetic]]

===Etymology===
{{unk.}}, many unproven theories exist. Probably originated among African Americans in the US South in the early 20th century or late 19th century.  Perhaps first used by British soldiers stationed in Palestine before 1948, based on the Hebrew הכל בסדר "ha-kol b-seder" (all is in order). Also, probably disputed (MW) + perhaps from כל בצדק "kol b-tsedeq" (all with justice) (AHD)(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Hebrew_origin - Copacetic)

Jazz historians attribute the word's coinage to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Robinson Bill "Bojangles" Robinson].
