{{en-noun|sg=[[centrifugal]] [[force]]}}
(from Latin centrum "center" and fugere "to flee")
# in everyday understanding, centrifugal force is the effect that tends to move an object away from the center of a circle it is rotating about (a consequence of [[inertia]]).
# {{physics}}: In a rotating reference frame, the [[apparent]] force that seems to push all bodies away from the [[centre]] of [[rotation]] of the frame and is a consequence of the body's [[mass]] and the frame's [[angular]] [[speed]]. It works in conjunction with the [[coriolis force]] to give correct motion.
# {{physics}}: In circular motion, the 'reactive' centrifugal force is a real force applied ''by'' the accelerating body that is [[equal]] and [[opposite]] to the [[centripetal force]] that is acting ''on'' the accelerating body.
# {{physics}}: In polar coordinates, the apparent radial force that seems to [[push]] a [[rotating]] body away from the [[centre]] of [[rotation]] of the frame and is a consequence of the body's [[angular]] [[speed]] around the origin.
