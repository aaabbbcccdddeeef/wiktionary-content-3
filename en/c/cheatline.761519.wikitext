In [[civil aviation]], a '''cheatline''' is a decorative horizontal band of color applied to both sides of an aircraft's [[fuselage]] of  as part of its livery. Cheatlines usually run over or under the windows through the entire lenghth of the passenger cabin, sometimes connecting at the nose or tail.

Cheatlines have essentially fallen out of fashion in the late [[1990s]] after decades of being a prominent feature on most airliners. However, many [[airline|airlines]] have kept their traditional liveries with cheatlines as a reminder of their long history and traditions.

Airlines with liveries featuring decades-old cheatline designs include [[American Airlines]], [[KLM]], [[Alitalia]], and [[LOT Polish Airlines]].
