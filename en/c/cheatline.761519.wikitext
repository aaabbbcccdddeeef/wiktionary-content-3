In [[civil aviation]], a '''cheatline''' is a decorative horizontal band of color applied to both sides of an aircraft's [[fuselage]] of  as part of its livery. Cheatlines usually run over or under the windows through the entire length of the passenger cabin, sometimes connecting at the nose or tail.

Cheatlines have essentially fallen out of fashion in the late [[1990s]] after decades of being a prominent feature on many airliners. However, some [[airline|airlines]] have kept their traditional liveries with cheatlines as an important aid to [[brand recognition]].

Airlines with liveries featuring decades-old cheatline designs include [[American Airlines]], [[Alitalia]], and [[LOT Polish Airlines]]. [[KLM]] has just recently changed its color scheme to one without a cheatline.
