I didn't mean to criticize Souvannaphouma solely. His XO, Cox'n and the rest of the personel could have gave their support to their CO.}}

I guess he doesn't want to lose his boat in the sea or to have any trouble, so he manages his business with wisdom. Last september, I stayed one full day in Koh Kong because it was impossible to travel due to the storm. The '''capitaine''' did not try to go. If the boat leave the port, it means thet it's 100% safe.The boats on the sea are 10 times better than the boat from PP to Siem Reap.}}

Even if injured or seeming to play uninspired hockey (relative to his old self, anyway), he's the '''capitaine''' and at least has a relatively longstanding reputation as a sparkplug and clutch scorer.}}
