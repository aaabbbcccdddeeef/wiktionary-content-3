'''Cubing'''? Cubistics? Rubikonomia? or perhaps Rubikomania? Can the science (or art) of doing it be called “cubology”, as suggested by ''Scientific American''? Some enthusiasts borrow “cubism” and call themselves “cubists”, all very reminiscent of the 1920s three dimensional, modern art phase.|brackets=on}}
