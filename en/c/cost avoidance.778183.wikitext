'''Cost avoidance''' is a [[management accounting]] term referring to an expense one has avoided incurring.  It is commonly used in the field of energy management to describe the energy costs you avoided due to energy management initiatives.  Several popular PC-based software programs calculate cost avoidance by comparing the current year with a prior-year baseline, adjusting for independent variables (such as weather, billing period length, etc) and applying the current cost of energy (since all energy that you avoid consuming must be valued at today's rates, not the base year rates).  See [[EnergyCAP]], [[Faser]] and [[Metrix]].
