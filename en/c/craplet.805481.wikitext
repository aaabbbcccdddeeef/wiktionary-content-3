A Craplet is a small application that is installed on your computer when you install another program or else a redundant utility purchsed on a new (almost always brand-name PC). These programs tend to eat resources without being of much use.

Generally these include small quick-launchers and redundant utilities (often seen on the right-hand side of the taskbar in the Microsoft Windows Operating System).
