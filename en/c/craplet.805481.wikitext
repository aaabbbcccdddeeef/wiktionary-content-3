A '''craplet''' is a small [[application]] that is [[install]]ed on your computer when you install another program or else a [[redundant]] [[utility]] purchased on a new (almost always brand-name PC). These programs tend to eat [[resource]]s without being of much use.

Generally these include small [[quick-launcher]]s and redundant utilities (often seen on the right-hand side of the [[taskbar]] in the [[Microsoft]] [[Windows (operating system)|Windows Operating System]]).
