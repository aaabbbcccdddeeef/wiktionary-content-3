{{en-noun}}

# A heavy, freight-hauling cart with a [[canvas]] cover drawn by [[mules]], [[oxen]] or [[horses]]. It should not be confused with the lighter prairie schooner that was used extensively during the westward expansion of the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conestoga_wagon].
