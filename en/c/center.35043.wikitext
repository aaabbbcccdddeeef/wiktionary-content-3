====Related terms====
* [[central]]

====Usage notes====
The indirect object of the intransitive verb is given the prepositions {{term|on}}, {{term|in}}, {{term|at}}{{,}} or {{term|around}}. {{term|at|At}} is primary used only in mathematical contexts.

Merriam-Webster's ''Collegiate Dictionary'' observes that {{term||center around}} is objected to by some people on the grounds that it is illogical, but states that it is an idiom, and thus that such objections are irrelevant. It offers {{term||[[revolve]] around}} as an alternative to {{term||center around}} for those who would avoid the idiom.
