For a given [[font]], '''cpi''' (characters per inch) is the number of typographic characters that fit on each inch of a line of printed type. The measurement applies mainly to fonts that have the same width for each character ([[font#Monospace_fonts|monospaced fonts]]). Fonts with characters of varying widths can have an average cpi.
