For a given [[font]], '''cpi''' (characters per inch, or '''pitch''') is the number of typographic characters that fit on each inch of a line of printed type. The measurement applies mainly to fonts that have the same width for each character ([[font#Monospace_fonts|monospaced fonts]]). Fonts with characters of varying widths can have an average cpi.

'''CPI''' also refers to the amount of Characters Per Inch when storing data on certain types of [[Magnetic_tape|magnetic tape]], an indication of the storage density that the tape posesses.
