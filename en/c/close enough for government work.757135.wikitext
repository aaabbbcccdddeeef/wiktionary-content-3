===Etymology===
Originated in World War II.  When something was "good enough for Government work" it meant it could pass the most rigorous of standards.  Over the years it has become a negative representation of poorly executed work, reflecting declining Federal Government expectations.  <!--i.e. the wackiest things have Federal Grants.-->
