This archaic slang-phrase was made popular in the 1960s.


More often used in the southern region of the United States, it is a reference to the seemingly inept performance of government officials and departments, but is not necessarily limited to use in governmental business.  


This phrase is used to indicate end results of a project or task that did not turn out as expected.  


Upon completion of the (usually routine) task, a person will say "that's close enough for government work", indicating that while it may not be exactly what was desired, it's done.
