==English==

===Etymology===
Originated in World War II.  When something was "good enough for Government work" it meant it could pass the most rigorous of standards.  Over the years it has become a negative representation of poorly executed work, reflecting declining Federal Government expectations.  <!--i.e. the wackiest things have Federal Grants.-->

"Government work" is also a term for the manufacture of something on company time for personal use.  Commonly heard in Ontario, Canada.  For example, a custom trailer hitch made at a welding shop on the afternoon shift with no supervisors around is government work.
