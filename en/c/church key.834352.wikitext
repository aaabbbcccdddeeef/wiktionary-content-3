# A [[can opener]] having a [[triangular]] tip that pierces the can.
#* '''2008''' Ted J. Gouin, ''Coco Colored Boy'', page 36
#*: Nobody was killed, but a guy from the rival gang was supposed to have had his eyes popped out with a '''church key'''.
#* '''2009''', Jim Lehrer, ''Eureka: A Novel'', page 81
#*: "{{...}}Once you didn't need a '''church key''' to open a can of beer much anymore, they didn't need me to go around handing out '''church keys''' anymore either."
#* '''2011''', Bobby Mercer, ''ManVentions: From Cruise Control to Cordless Drills'', page 58-59
#*: The triangle end of the '''church key''' was the most important part in the early days. To get into the cans, drinkers would create two triangular Vs in the top of the can (opposite each other to let air in so the beer would pour out easily) and away they went. The other end of the '''church key''' was used to pop off the “crown cork” that is still in use to seal glass beer bottles today.
