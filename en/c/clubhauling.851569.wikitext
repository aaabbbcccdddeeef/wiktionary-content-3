# {{lb|en|nautical}} A risky maneuver whereby a sail-boat [[tacks]] (turns into and through the wind) by dropping one of the front anchors, the intent being to turn the boat in a tighter space than would be possible using the rudder and sails alone, especially when difficult conditions such as light winds or heavy swell make tacking more difficult than usual.
