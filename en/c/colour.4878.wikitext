*both ''color'' and ''colour'' forms are accepted in Canadian English

===Etymology===
{{L.}} ''[[color]]'', via Old French ''[[coulour]]''; the US spelling, which excludes the ''u'', was chosen to conform to the word's Latin origin, and to make all derivatives consistent (''colorimeter'', ''colorize'', ''colorless'', etc; see below). Elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the ''u'' has been retained.
