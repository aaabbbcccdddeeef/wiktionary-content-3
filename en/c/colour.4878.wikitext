====Usage notes====
The late {{cog|xno|colour}}, which is the standard UK spelling, has been the usual spelling in Britain since the 14th century and was chosen by {{w|Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson's}} ''{{w|A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1755) along with other Anglo-Norman spellings such as [[favour]], [[honour]], etc. The Latin spelling ''colour'' was occasionally used from the 15th century onward, mainly due to Latin influence; it was lemmatized by {{w|Noah Webster|Webster's}} ''{{w|Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1828), along with [[favor]], [[honor]], etc., and is currently the standard US spelling.

In Canada, ''colour'' is preferred, but ''colour'' is not unknown; in Australia, ''-our'' endings are the standard, although ''-or'' endings had some currency in the past and are still sporadically found in some regions. In New Zealand and South Africa, ''-our'' endings are the standard.
