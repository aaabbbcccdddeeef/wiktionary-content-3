===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{m|enm|color}}, {{m|enm|colour}}, from {{etyl|xno|en}} {{m|fro|colur}}, from {{etyl|fro|en}} {{m|fro|colour}}, {{m|fro|color}}, from {{etyl|la|en}} {{m|la|color}}, from {{etyl|itc-ola|en}} {{m|itc-ola|colos||covering}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{m|ine-pro|*ḱel-||to cover, conceal}}. Akin to Latin {{m|la|cēlō||I hide, conceal}}, Old English {{m|ang|helan}} {{gloss|"to conceal, cover, hide"; see {{l|en|hele}}}}. Displaced [[Middle English]] {{m|enm|blee||colour}}, from Old English {{m|ang|blēo}}. More at [[blee]]. Compare Dutch {{m|nl|kleur||color}}, Danish {{m|da|kulør||color}}, Swedish {{m|sv|kulör||color}}.

In the US, the spelling ''color'' is used to match the spelling of the word's Latin etymon{{,}} and to make all derivatives consistent (''colorimeter'', ''colorize'', ''colorless'', etc). Elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the spelling ''colour'' has been retained.

====Usage notes====
The late {{etyl|xno|en}} ''colour'', which is the standard UK spelling, has been the usual spelling in Britain since the 14th century and was chosen by {{w|Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson}}'s ''{{w|A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1755) along with other {{etyl|xno|en}} spellings such as [[favour]], [[honour]], etc. The Latin spelling ''color'' was occasionally used from the 15th century onwards, mainly due to Latin influence; it was lemmatized by {{w|Noah Webster|Webster}}'s ''{{w|Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1828), along with [[favor]], [[honor]], etc., and is currently the standard US spelling.

In Canada, ''colour'' is preferred, but ''color'' is not unknown; in Australia, ''-our'' endings are the standard, although ''-or'' endings had some currency in the past and are still sporadically found in some regions. In New Zealand, ''-our'' endings are the standard.
