===Etymology===
{{etyl|enm|en}} {{term|color|colo(u)r|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|xno|en}} {{term|colur|lang=fro}}, from {{etyl|fro|en}} {{term|colour|lang=fro}}, {{term|color|lang=fro}}, from {{etyl|la|en}} {{term|color|lang=la}}, from {{etyl|itc-ola|en}} ''[[colos]]'' "covering", from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{term/t|ine-pro|*kel-||to cover, conceal}}. Akin to Latin {{term/t|la|cēlō||I hide, conceal}}. Displaced [[Middle English]] {{term|blee||colour|lang=enm}}, from Old English {{term/t|ang|blēo}}. More at [[blee]].

In the US, the spelling ''color'' is used to match the spelling of the word's Latin etymon{{,}} and to make all derivatives consistent (''colorimeter'', ''colorize'', ''colorless'', etc). Elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the spelling ''colour'' has been retained.

====Usage notes====
The late {{etyl|xno|en}} ''colour'', which is the standard UK spelling, has been the usual spelling in Britain since the 14th century and was chosen by {{w|Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson}}'s ''{{w|A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1755) along with other {{etyl|xno|en}} spellings such as [[favour]], [[honour]], etc. The Latin spelling ''color'' was occasionally used from the 15th century onward, mainly due to Latin influence; it was lemmatized by {{w|Noah Webster|Webster}}'s ''{{w|Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1828), along with [[favor]], [[honor]], etc., and is currently the standard US spelling.

In Canada, ''colour'' is preferred, but ''color'' is not unknown; in Australia, ''-our'' endings are the standard, although ''-or'' endings had some currency in the past and are still sporadically found in some regions.
