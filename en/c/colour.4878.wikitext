==English==

===Alternative spellings===
* [[color]] (''US'')
* both ''color'' and ''colour'' forms are accepted in Canadian English; however, the Federal Government uses ''-our'' endings (along with other British spellings), making ''colour'' the preferred spelling.

===Etymology===
{{L.}} ''[[color]]'', via Old French ''[[coulour]]''; the US spelling, which excludes the ''u'', was chosen to conform to the word's Latin origin, and to make all derivatives consistent (''colorimeter'', ''colorize'', ''colorless'', etc; see below). Elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the ''u'' has been retained.

===Pronunciation===

** {{SAMPA|/"kVl@/}}
* (''US''):
** {{enPR|/kŭlʹər/}}
** {{IPA|/ˈkʌlɚ/}}
