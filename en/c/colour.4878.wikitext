==English==

===Etymology===
From Latin "color" via Old French "coulour"; in U.S. spelling the 'u' was dropped from ''colour'' to conform to the word's Latin origin, and to make all derivatives consistent (''colorimeter'', ''colorize'', ''colorless'', etc. -- see below). In the rest of the English-speaking world the 'u' remains.
