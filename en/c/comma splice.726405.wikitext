{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|grammar}} Two [[independent clause]]s combined into a [[run-on sentence]] with only a [[comma]] between them.

====Usage notes====
* In English, the use of a comma splice is generally considered to be an error. It is better to separate two related sentences with a [[semicolon]], to join them with a [[conjunction]], or to write two separate sentences.
