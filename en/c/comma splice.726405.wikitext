{{en-noun|head=[[comma]] [[splice]]}}

# {{grammar}} Two [[independent clause]]s strung together with a [[comma]] in between.

====Usage notes====
*In English, the use of a comma splice is generally considered to be an error.  It is better to separate two related sentences with a [[semicolon]], to join them with a [[conjunction]], or to write two separate sentences.
