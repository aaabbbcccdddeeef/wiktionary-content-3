# A fossil formed when an animal, plant, or other [[organism]] dies, its [[flesh]] [[decay]]s and [[bone]]s [[deteriorate]] due to chemical reactions; minerals gradually enter into the cavity, resulting in a [[cast]], which is in the general form of the original organism. A [[mold fossil]] is the rock that surrounds the cast fossil in which the cavity is in the shape of the fossil (very similar to a clay mold).
