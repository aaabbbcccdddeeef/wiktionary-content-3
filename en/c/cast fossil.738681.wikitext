# A fossil formed when an animal, plant, or other [[organism]] dies, its [[flesh]] [[decay]]s and [[bone]]s [[deteriorate]] due to chemical reactions; minerals gradually enter into the cavity, resulting in a [[cast]], also called a [[mold fossil]], which is in the general form of the original organism. There is also a cast fossil being shipped to class rooms.
