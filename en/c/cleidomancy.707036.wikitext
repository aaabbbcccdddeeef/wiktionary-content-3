#* '''1931''', J. Courtenay Locke, translator, [[w:Émile-Jules Grillot de Givry|Émile-Jules Grillot de Givry]], author, ''Picture Museum of Sorcery, Magic & Alchemy'':
#*: '''Cleidomancy''' was performed with a key suspended from a thread from the nail of a young virgin's third finger, this verse from the Psalms being repeated meanwhile: "Exurge, Domine, adjuva nos, et redime nos propter nomen sanctum tuum." The key would revolve if the thing asked could be affirmed.
