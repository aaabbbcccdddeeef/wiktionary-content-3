#* '''1599''' William Shakespeare, ''King Henry V'', Act I, Scene II:
#*: '''Charles''' the Great / Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French / Beyond the river Sala, in the year / Eight hundred five.
#* '''1844''' Edgar Allan Poe: ''Thou Art the Man'':
#*: - - - there never was any person named '''Charles''' who was not an open, manly, honest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear, voice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked at you always straight at the face, as much as to say: "I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action." And thus all the hearty, careless,'walking gentlemen' of the stage are very certain to be called '''Charles'''. ( ''Note: Charles turns out to be the villain of this story.'')
#* '''1988''' Ed McBain: ''The House That Jack Built'': page 212:
#*: - - - spoke the way the English do, funny, you know? His name was Roger, I think. Or Nigel. Something like that." / "How about '''Charles'''?" / "'''Charles'''? Well, yes, it could have been.'''Charles''' does sound English, doesn't it? Their prince is named '''Charles''', isn't he?"
