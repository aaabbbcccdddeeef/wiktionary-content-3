* '''1844''' Edgar Allan Poe: ''Thou Art the Man'':
*: - - - there never was any person named '''Charles''' who was not an open, manly, honest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear, voice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked at you always straight at the face, as much as to say: "I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action." And thus all the hearty, careless,'walking gentlemen' of the stage are very certain to be called '''Charles'''. ( ''Note: Charles turns out to be the villain of this story.'')
