=====Usage notes=====
In its general sense, ''come'' specifically marks motion {{l|en|towards}} the [[w:Deixis|deictic]] centre, (whether explicitly stated or not). Its counterpart, usually referring to motion away from or not involving the deictic centre, is {{m|en|go}}. For example, the sentence "Come to the tree" implies contextually that the speaker is already at the tree — "Go to the tree" often implies that the speaker is elsewhere. Either the speaker or the listener can be the deictic centre — the sentences "I will go to you" and "I will come to you" are both valid, depending on the exact nuances of the context. When there is no clear speaker or listener, the deictic centre is usually the focus of the sentence or the topic of the piece of writing. "Millions of people '''came''' to America from Europe" would be used in an article about America, but "Millions of people '''went''' to America from Europe" would be used in an article about Europe.

When used with adverbs of location, ''come'' is usually paired with {{m|en|here}} or {{m|en|hither}}. In interrogatives, ''come'' usually indicates a question about source — "Where are you coming from?" — while ''go'' indicates a question about destination — "Where are you going?" or "Where are you going to?"

A few old texts use {{m|en|comen}} as the past participle. Also, in some dialects, like rural Scots and rural Midlands dialects, the form {{m|en|comen}} is still occasionally in use, so phrases like the following can still be encountered there — ''Sa thoo bist comen heyr to nim min 'orse frae mee, then?'' {{IPAchar|[sä ðuː bɪst cʊmn̩ hiər tə nɪm miːn ɔːrs frə miː {{!}} d̪ɛn]}} (so you have come here to steal my horse from me, then?).

Formerly the verb {{m|en|be}} was used as the auxiliary instead of {{m|en|have}}, for example, ''Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and '''are''' come to worship him.''

The phrase "dream come true" is a set phrase; the verb "come" in the sense "become" is archaic outside of some set phrases like {{m|en|come about}}, {{m|en|come loose}}, {{m|en|come true}} and {{m|en|come undone}}.

The collocations {{m|en|come with}} and {{m|en|come along}} mean {{m|en|accompany}}, used as "Do you want to come with me?" and "Do you want to come along?" In the Midwestern American dialect, "come with" can occur without a following object, as in "Do you want to come with?" In this dialect, "with" can also be used in this way with some other verbs, such as "take with". Examples of this may be found in plays by Chicagoan {{w|David Mamet}}, such as ''{{w|American Buffalo}}.''<ref>[http://positiveanymore.blogspot.com/2006/04/chicago-dialect.html Chicago Dialect]</ref> This objectless use is not permissible in other dialects.

The meaning of ''to ejaculate'' is considered vulgar slang. Many style guides and editors recommend the spelling ''come'' for verb uses while strictly allowing the spelling {{m|en|cum}} for the noun. Both spellings are sometimes found in either the noun or verb sense, however. Others prefer to distinguish in formality, using ''come'' for any formal usage and ''cum'' only in slang, erotic or pornographic contexts.<ref>[http://www.glossophilia.org/?p=4925 Glossophilia]</ref>

In older forms of English, when the pronoun ''[[thou]]'' was in active use, and verbs used ''[[-est]]'' for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb ''come'' had the form ''[[comest]]'', and had ''[[camest]]'' for its past tense. Similarly, when the ending ''[[-eth]]'' was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form ''[[cometh]]'' was used.

====Noun====
{{en-noun|-}}

# {{lb|en|obsolete}} [[coming|Coming]], [[arrival]]; [[approach]].
#* '''1869''', RD Blackmoore, ''Lorna Doone'', II:
#*: “If we count three before the '''come''' of thee, thwacked thou art, and must go to the women.”
# {{lb|en|vulgar|slang}} [[semen|Semen]]
# {{lb|en|vulgar|slang}} Female [[ejaculatory]] [[discharge]].

=====Usage notes=====
The meaning of ''semen or female ejaculatory discharge'' is considered vulgar slang. Many style guides and editors recommend the spelling ''come'' for verb uses while strictly allowing the spelling {{m|en|cum}} for the noun. Both spellings are sometimes found in either the noun or verb sense, however. Others prefer to distinguish in formality, using ''come'' for any formal usage and ''cum'' only in slang, erotic or pornographic contexts.<ref>[http://www.glossophilia.org/?p=4925 Glossophilia]</ref>

* {{l|en|cum}}
