{{wikipedia}}

===Etymology 1===
{{inh|en|enm|cotoun}}, from {{der|en|xno|cotun}}, {{der|en|fro|coton}}, from (Genoese) {{der|en|roa-oit|cotone}}, from {{der|en|ar|قُطُن}}, of uncertain origin. There is no apparent semantic link between the Arabic words and the root {{ar-root|ق ط ن|nocat=1}}, leading to suggestions that they are corruptions of other words, such as {{m|ar|كَتّان|t=flax}} or (more distant phonologically) {{m|ar|جَفْنَة|t=vine}}. Cognate to {{cog|nl|katoen}}, {{cog|de|Kattun}}, {{cog|it|cotone}}, {{cog|es|algodón}}, and {{cog|pt|algodão}}.
