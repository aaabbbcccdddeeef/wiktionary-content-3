This phrase, arguably coined by Roger Beharry Lall in 2005, describes a class of worker which is highly mobile, yet 'stationary' - working in the confines of a specific physical structure such as a school campus, hospital ward, manufacturing plant, etc.   Typically, these workers spend >20% of their day away from their 'desks', and in many cases may not even have a specific assigned desk.   These workers' mobile requirements are often overlooked in favour of the more common (often more outspoken) Road Warrior class of worker (Sales reps, Traveling executives, field service staff, etc.) 

Addressing the technical needs of the Corridor Warrior often requires different solutions than the typical 'on-the-road'/'out of the office' type worker may demand (eg. cell phones or BlackBerry).  Corridor Warrior solutions are often WiFi based or simple synch-based tools. Examples might include many Symbol Devices, BlackBerry 7270 for WiFi, Palm Pilots, WiFi Laptops, etc.
More robust solutions for the Corridor Warrior also address VoIP, PBX integration, as well as standard push email, database access, IM, and wireless enabled Applications
