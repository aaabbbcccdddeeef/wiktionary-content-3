Corridor Warrior

Arguably coined by Roger Beharry Lall at various Wireless and Voice conferences in 2005, this class of worker is one which is highly mobile, but primarily based in the confines of a specific physical structure such as a school campus, hospital ward, manufacturing plant, etc.   Typically, these workers spend >20% of their day away from their 'desks', and in many cases may not even have a specific assigned desk.   

These workers' mobile requirements are often overlooked in favour of the more common (often more outspoken) Road Warrior class of worker

Corridor Warriors often require different technical solutions which may or may not include typical 'on-the-road'/'out of the office' type technologies like cell phones or BlackBerries.
Corridor Warrior solutions are often WiFi based or simple synch-based tools. Examples might include many Symbol Devices, BlackBerry 7270 for WiFi, Palm Pilots, WiFi Laptops, etc.
More robust solutions for the Corridor Warrior also address VoIP, PBX integration, as well as standard push email, database access, IM, and wireless enabled Applications
