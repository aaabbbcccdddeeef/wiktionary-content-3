===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|coude}}, {{m|enm|couthe}}, {{m|enm|cuthe}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|cūþe}}, past indicative and past subjunctive form of {{m|ang|cunnan||to be able}} (compare related {{m|ang|cūþ}} > English {{m|en|couth}}). The addition of the silent 'l' was likely a misappropriation attempting to normalize with modal verbs {{m|en|will}}/{{m|en|would}} and {{m|en|shall}}/{{m|en|should}}.
However, while the letter l was historically pronounced in the latter two, ''could'' never had an l sound in it.
