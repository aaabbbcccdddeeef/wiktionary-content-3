===Etymology===
{{PIE root|en|ǵneh₃}}
From {{inh|en|enm|coude}}, {{m|enm|couthe}}, {{m|enm|cuthe}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{m|ang|cūþe}}, past indicative and past subjunctive form of {{m|ang|cunnan||to be able}} (compare related {{m|ang|cūþ}}, whence English {{m|en|couth}}). The silent 'l' was added in the early 16th century by analogy with ''should'' and ''would'', at which time the 'l' in those words was already also silent (and was sometimes not written, leading to ''shudd'', ''wode'', etc).<ref>Christopher Upward, George Davidson, ''The History of English Spelling'' (2011), section "Silent L"</ref>
