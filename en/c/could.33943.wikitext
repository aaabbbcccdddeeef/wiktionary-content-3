===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*ǵneh₃-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|coude}}, {{m|enm|couthe}}, {{m|enm|cuthe}}, from {{inh|en|ang|cūþe}}, past indicative and past subjunctive form of {{m|ang|cunnan||to be able}} (compare related {{m|ang|cūþ}}, whence English {{m|en|couth}}). The 'l' was added in the early 16th century by analogy with ''should'' and ''would''; this was probably helped by the tendency for 'l' to be lost in those words  (and so not written, leading to ''shudd'', ''wode'', etc).<ref>{{R:OED Online|entry=can|pos=v.1|id=26857|date=March 2017}}</ref><ref>Christopher Upward, George Davidson, ''The History of English Spelling'' (2011), section "Silent L"</ref>

* {{l|en|could've}}
