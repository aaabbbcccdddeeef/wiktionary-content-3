===Alternative forms===
* [[cou’d]] {{qualifier|obsolete}}

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm|en}} {{term|coude|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{term|cuþ||lang=ang}}, preterite form of {{term|cunnan||lang=ang|to be able}}. The addition of the silent 'l' was likely a misappropriation attempting to normalize with modal verbs {{term|will|lang=en}}/{{term|would|lang=en}} and {{term|shall|lang=en}}/{{term|should|lang=en}}. 
However, while the letter l was historically pronounced in the latter two, can never did have an l sound in it.
