#A decorative cord worn on the [[shoulder]], generally in conjunction with a [[uniform]], also known as an Aiguillette.  As pictured, this cord is being worn backwards (see Highty-Tighties [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highty-Tighties]).  Instead, the thick braid goes under the arm, with the narrow strands outside.
