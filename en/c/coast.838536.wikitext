Something or someone is '''coasting''' when it is, or they are, moving at a steady speed, perhaps on wheels or rails. Coasting, for any distance, requires that [[friction]] be minimal.

Applied to [[human behavior]], coasting is making a minimal effort, continuing to do something in a routine way. It implies lack of [[initiative]] and [[effort]].
