===Etymology 2===
Uncertain. Some authors speculate it derives from {{m|en|cockle}}, a [[yonic]] fertility symbol,<ref>Elijah Wald, ''The Dozens: A History of Rap's Mama''</ref> others suggested it entered Southern US vernacular during the period of French rule (of Louisiana) from {{cog|frc|coquille||shell}} (itself the source of {{m|en|cockle}}), which in 18th and 19th century slang meant the vulva.<ref>Vance Randolph, ''Unprintable Ozark Folksongs and Folklore: Roll me in your arms, Volume 1'': "''cock'' [...] is a southernism [...] where a northerner would say, or expect, ''cunt''. This confusing usage originated during the French domination of the U. S. south; it comes from the French term, [...] ''coquille'', cockleshell, for the vagina"; the work has examples from as early as 1927</ref>
